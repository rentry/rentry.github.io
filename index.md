## Hi, I'm Ryan

I live in the woods just outside Portland, Oregon. My work is in content strategy, writing, design, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

Over the past several years, I've been working to improve government digital services, most recently at [18F](https://18f.org/), the [Department of Homeland Security](https://ohss.dhs.gov/), and [Oregon Department of Human Services](https://www.oregon.gov/odhs/pages/default.aspx).

When I'm not working, I'm likely walking among trees or [reading a book]({{ '/books/' | relative_url }}). I also served for four years as a [search and rescue volunteer]({{ '/tags/#search%20and%20rescue' | relative_url }}) and currently volunteer with [Trailkeepers of Oregon](https://trailkeepersoforegon.org/).
