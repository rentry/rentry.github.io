# I'm Ryan.

I live in the woods just outside Portland, Oregon. My work is in content strategy, communication, writing, design, programming, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

Over the past several years, I've been working to improve government services, most recently at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

When I'm not working, I'm likely reading a book or walking among trees.
