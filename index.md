## Words and maps

Iâ€™m a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon.  

I specialize in public-sector content strategy, editorial standards, and accessibility. Lately, I've been working on information architecture, data-driven content design, and data visualization.

I am also a map geek, which inspired me to earn a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Science. As a result, I have experience in remote sensing, cartographic representation, and spatial analysis.

Apart from these pursuits, I spend as much time as possible in the woods and around the campfire with my wife and two dogs.

Sometimes, [I express opinions in writing](/posts).
