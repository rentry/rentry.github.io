# Hi. I'm Ryan.

I’m a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon. My background is in conservation, communication, design, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

Lately, I’ve been working with a small team to keep government data open and useful.

I spend my free time walking among trees.
