## 👋 Hello, from Oregon

I’m a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon. My background is in conservation, communication, design, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

Lately, I’ve been working on data-driven content design, information architecture, cartography, and data visualization.

I spend my free time walking among trees.
