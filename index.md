# Hi. I'm Ryan.

I live just outside Portland, Oregon. My background is in content strategy, communication, writing, design, programming, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

Over the last several years, I've been working to improve government services, most recently at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/).

I spend my free time walking among trees.
