## Words and maps

I am a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon.  

I specialize in public sector web content strategy, editorial standards, and accessibility. I produce style guides, policy, and strategy that recognize the unique challenges and opportunities of digital communications in government. Mostly, I make sure words do their job.

I am also a map geek, which inspired me to earn a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Science. As a result, I have experience in remote sensing, cartographic representation, and spatial analysis. 

Lately, Iâ€™ve been throwing a little data visualization into the mix as well, working with open data at the U.S. Department of the Interior.

In the past, I worked in the non-profit sector, primarily in watershed protection, restoration, and education. I remain committed to causes that promote watershed health and protection. 

Apart from these pursuits, I spend as much time as possible in the woods and around the campfire with my wife and two dogs.
