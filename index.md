# Words and maps

Hi, I'm Ryan. I live in the woods just outside Portland, Oregon. My work is in content strategy, writing, design, front-end development, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

Over the past several years, I've been working to improve government services, most recently at [18F](https://18f.gsa.gov/). 

When I'm not working, I'm likely reading a book, walking among trees, or serving as a [search and rescue volunteer]({{ '/joining-search-and-rescue-part-1/' | relative_url }}).
