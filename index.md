## Words and maps

I’m a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon. My background is in communications, design, publishing, development, and GIS.

Lately, I’ve been working on [data-driven content design](/content-writes-itself/#content-that-writes-itself), information architecture, cartography, and data visualization.

You can check out my recent work on GitHub at <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[{% include github_icon.html %} rentry](https://github.com/rentry)</span> and <span style="white-space: nowrap;">[{% include github_icon.html %} brentryanjohnson](https://github.com/brentryanjohnson)</span>.

I'm a compulsive reader, often reading several books at a time (not an ideal habit). In 2019, I [started a list of books](/books) I've recently read or am now reading. I prefer books, [like cameras](/slowing-down-with-analog/), of the analog variety.

Apart from these pursuits, I spend as much time as possible in the woods and around the campfire with my partner and our two dogs.

Sometimes, [I express opinions in writing](/posts).
