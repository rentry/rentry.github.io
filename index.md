## Hi, I'm Ryan

I live in the woods just outside Portland, Oregon. My work is in content strategy, writing, design, and [GIS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geographic_information_science).

After nearly a decade in public service working to improve government digital services, I'm now a Senior UX Strategist at [Madison Ave. Collective](https://www.madcollective.com/).

When I'm not working, I'm likely walking among trees, [reading a book]({{ '/books/' | relative_url }}), or volunteering.

I served as a [search and rescue volunteer]({{ '/tags/#search%20and%20rescue' | relative_url }}) for four years and currently volunteer with [{% include tko_icon.html %} Trailkeepers of Oregon](https://trailkeepersoforegon.org/), [{% include rubicon_icon.html %} Team Rubicon](https://teamrubiconusa.org/), and [{% include fifty-states_icon.html %} 50 States for Ukraine](https://www.50statesforukraine.com/). I also occasionally volunteer [📷 photography services]({{ '/pnw-survival-games/' | relative_url }}).
