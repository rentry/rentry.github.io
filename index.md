## Words and maps

I’m a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon. My background is in communications, design, publishing, and GIS.

Lately, I’ve been working on [data-driven content design](/content-writes-itself/#content-that-writes-itself), information architecture, cartography, and data visualization.

You can check out much my recent work on GitHub at [{% include github_icon.html %} rentry](https://github.com/rentry) and [{% include github_icon.html %} brentryanjohnson](https://github.com/brentryanjohnson).

You’ll often find me behind a camera, usually [an analog one](/slowing-down-with-analog/).

Apart from these pursuits, I spend as much time as possible in the woods and around the campfire with my partner and our two dogs.

Sometimes, [I express opinions in writing](/posts).
