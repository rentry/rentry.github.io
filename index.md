## Words and maps

I’m a content strategist living in Portland, Oregon.  

I specialize in public-sector content strategy, editorial standards, and accessibility. I produce style guides, policy, and strategy that recognize the unique challenges and opportunities of digital communications in government. Lately, I've been working on information architecture, data-driven content design, and data visualization.

I am also a map geek, which inspired me to earn a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Science. As a result, I have experience in remote sensing, cartographic representation, and spatial analysis.

In the past, I worked in the nonprofit sector, primarily in watershed protection, restoration, and education. I remain committed to causes that promote watershed health and protection. 

Apart from these pursuits, I spend as much time as possible in the woods and around the campfire with my wife and two dogs.
