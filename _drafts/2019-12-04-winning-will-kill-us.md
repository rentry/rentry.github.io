title: "A confusing rant about how our culture of winning will doom us all"
date: 2019-12-04
description: Darwin posited the theory of survival of the fittest (or luckiest). We’re told competition can lead to better outcomes and “exceptionalism”. Meanwhile, competition, especially economic competition, appear antithetical to biblical guidance, though you wouldn’t know it if you observed any prominent evangelical Christian. How do we deal with competition?
