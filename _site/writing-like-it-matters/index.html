  <article class="post-content">
    <p>It’s been awhile since I’ve written. Regularly, anyway.</p>

<p>Let me clarify; I write a lot. I’m an editor for a government website. I write all the time.</p>

<p>It’s just that I haven’t written for the purpose of processing and exposing my own thoughts for some time. Perhaps it’s because there are too many words out there already. Perhaps it’s because I became complacent.</p>

<p>Curiously, I’ve felt compelled to write again recently. Like many, I was stunned by the result of the presidential election, and I am aghast at <a href="http://billmoyers.com/story/trump-the-american-fascist/">our national descent into fascism</a>, the <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/13/a_list_of_racist_incidents_across_the_united_states_since_donald_trump_was.html">brazen, hateful attacks</a> that are a hallmark of too many of Trump’s supporters, and the <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/21/politics/trump-putin-killing-reporters/index.html">candid threats to journalists</a> and those who would hold a Trump administration accountable.</p>

<p>Trump isn’t even president yet, but his election has already exposed and validated so much that’s wrong with our country.</p>

<p>Frankly, we had a big problem well before the election. This book was published in 2004; I just found out about it recently, <a href="http://aworkinglibrary.com/editor/jennifer-harvey/">thanks to Mandy Brown</a>:</p>

<p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Disrupting-Supremacy-Within-Jennifer-Harvey/dp/0829816070/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1483772472&amp;sr=1-2"><img src="https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oWLi%2BzrnL.jpg" alt="Disrupting White Supremacy from Within" /></a></p>

<p>I’m reading it now.</p>

<p>The fact that this book has to exist is unfortunate enough; the fact that it’s as relevant as it’s ever been is terrifying.</p>

<p>Perhaps more terrifying is <a href="http://www.climatecentral.org/news/trump-cabinet-climate-change-20920">the collective rejection of and hostility toward indisputable climate science</a> from Trump’s proposed cabinet.</p>

<p>We just don’t have time for this bullshit.</p>

<p>It turns out we need <em>more</em> words. In particular, we need words that aren’t generated in an ad-funded bullshit factory. We need words that demonstrate genuine care for others, a commitment to facts and research, a reverence for life and diversity, and an acknowledgement that we are truly in a dangerous time.</p>

<p>So I will write. I will write about politics, books, film, and the web. I will write because it’s integral to exercising democratic freedom. I will write to resist. And I will write to avoid complacency.</p>
