# Join us for a housewarming

Hi friends! It's been a minute.

We recently moved into a new, _old_ farmhouse in the country, and we'd like you to come by and visit us.

- **Saturday, October 13** <br>
4 p.m. to whenever<br>
24765 S Beavercreek Road <br> 
Beavercreek, Oregon 97004

## Park on Kelley Creek Lane
It's probably easiest to park along Kelley Creek Lane, which runs by our house to the south. Park on the grass between our fence and the road. There's a gate over there: walk on in! Just remember to close the gate behind you; we'll have some dogs running around.

## What to bring
We'll grill some meats and provide some side dishes, but feel free to bring snacks or beverages (especially if you don't want to eat meat).

## Pet stuff
As you know, dogs will be here. Some of them are super cute and _super_ emotional (we all know I'm talking about Henry).

Our dogs are good boys (especially Sam), but if you want to bring kids and/or dogs with you, let us know so we can plan accordingly.

## What if it rains?!?
Rain sounds really, really good right now, but I'm sure we'll be sick of it again soon. If it rains: we have a large, covered shop. We have an REI canopy to seek refuge under. Oh, and there's a house. So we're good.

## The elephant in the room
There is a [football game](https://goducks.com/schedule.aspx?schedule=2357) ‚Äì <span class="ducks">Ducks</span> vs. <span class="enemy">The Enemy</span> ‚Äì scheduled for Oct. 13. The exact time for this epic and sacred battle is yet to be determined. This unfortunate accident of history might affect the attention and focus of one of the hosts (and possibly some guests). But alas, we will adapt, and we shall not worry.
