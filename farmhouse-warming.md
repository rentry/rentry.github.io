# Join us for a housewarming

Hi friends! It's been a minute.

We recently moved into a new, old farmhouse in the country, and we'd like you to come by and visit us.

- **Saturday, October 13** <br>
    - <time>4 p.m. to whenever</time>
    - <address>24765 S Beavercreek Road <br> Beavercreek, Oregon 97004</address>

## Park on Kelley Creek Lane
It's probably easiest to park along Kelley Creek Lane, which runs by our house to the south. Park on the grass between our fence and the road. There's a gate over there: walk on in!

## Don't bring anything (except kids and/or dogs)
We'll make some meaty foods, and some not-so-meaty foods, and some snacks. [Let us know](mailto:brentryanjohnson@gmail.com?subject=Meal preference) if you need something specific and we'll do that, too.

There will be dogs here, some of whom are super emotional (we all know I'm talking about Henry).

We have ways to fence dogs and humans, so it should be cool. If you have a dog to bring, we have a field that's open to dog play. Let us know if you want to bring your dog!

## What if it rains?!?
Writing this in August, rain sounds really, really good. But I'm sure we'll be sick of it again soon. If it rains: we have a large, covered shop, a house, and a canopy to seek refuge under. So we're good.

## The elephant in the room
There is a [football game](https://goducks.com/schedule.aspx?schedule=2357) ‚Äì <span class="ducks">Ducks</span> vs. <span class="enemy">Dogs</span> ‚Äì scheduled for Oct. 13. The exact time for this epic and sacred battle is yet to be determined. This unfortunate accident of history will affect how and where some of the proceedings may occur. But alas, we will adapt, and we shall not worry.
