This is exhausting. Every day I wake up and realize it's another day in an absurd new reality, one that unapologetically sanctions hatred, bigotry, and a shocking level of hypocrisy. 

Supporters of this new corrosive paradigm are more than willing to ignore the hypocrisies in order to see their bigotry validated. And those who resist have few representatives in power that can provide a meaningful challenge. Meanwhile, Trump supporters, some of whom are my friends and family, point out that the way I (and most of the U.S.) feel right now is how they felt during the Obama years. Considering the Obama administration took down bin Laden, pulled us out of a debilitating recession, and added over 9 million jobs, it's difficult to understand how that record compares to a man who uses Twitter like a 12 year-old, [makes fun of people who are disabled](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/09/meryl-streep-was-right-donald-trump-did-mock-a-disabled-reporter/?utm_term=.fda71eb078fb), is a [serial misogynist](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/politics/donald-trump-sexism-tracker-every-offensive-comment-in-one-place/), advocated for 2nd Amendment supporters to ["do something"](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/10/us/politics/donald-trump-hillary-clinton.html) about his political opponents, [and has stuffed his White House with racists](https://www.salon.com/2017/02/14/donald-trumps-white-nationalist-genius-bar-steve-bannon-stephen-miller-michael-decius-anton-and-beyond/).

He antagonizes the media and emboldens the uneducated in the name of (faux) populism that's set on destroying democratic institutions while enriching the very "swamp" he professed to "drain".

I suppose these "interpretations" of Trump's actions are just "fake news," right? 

There are those who compel the resistance to listen to the supporters of this administration, which looks increasingly fascist every day. It's a nice idea, in principle. Those on the left cherish dialogue, understanding, and compromise, for good reason. They are essential aspects of civilization and democracy.

But when you observe those who are willing to look past the Russian ties, the misogyny, the war on the media, the hypocrisy, the racism, the incompetence, and the propensity towards fascism, it's difficult to see how a productive dialogue is possible. They hold onto their views with an almost religious fervor, which is convenient, because many of them indeed claim to be "Christian". 

The truth is, you can't argue with a belief that is held to be metaphysical. And you can't argue when one side believes in the oxymoron of "alternative facts." 

## The dialectic

With admitted oversimplification, the Hegelian dialectic posited that a thesis and antithesis would confront one another and preserve the the best in each. This "sublation" would describe the progression of history, or the advancement of human understanding and the evolution of human ideas.

We no longer have a dialectic. We have a war of ideas that produces no fusion, but rather walls and blockades. It's toxic to democracy and fatal to progress, but frankly very few people are willing to do much about it. I, for one, have been unwilling to listen to ideas that accept xenophobia, sexism, and fascism as predicates to political discourse. Others dismiss those with views like mine as "snowflakes" who don't understand "reality" and their unforgiving dominance theory of economic and social activity.

And so the dialectic stalls. There is little room here for any kind of progress. It appears to be a regression to a winner-takes-all anti-civilization that will continue to perpetuate the vast inequality that has given rise to this clusterfuck in the first place [(the rate of return on capital continues to outpace the overall growth of the economy)](http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674430006). 

Maybe we should be talking more about capitalism? Or is capitalism the ultimate religion of this country?

I don't know where we go from here, but I hope we find our way soon.
