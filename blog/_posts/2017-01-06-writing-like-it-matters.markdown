It's been awhile since I've written. Regularly, anyway. 

Let me clarify; I write a lot. I'm an editor for a government website. I write all the time. 

It's just that I haven't written for the purpose of processing and exposing my own thoughts for some time. Perhaps it's because there are too many words out there already. Perhaps it's because I became complacent.

Curiously, I've felt compelled to write again recently. Like many, I was stunned by the result of the presidential election, and I am aghast at [our national descent into fascism](http://billmoyers.com/story/trump-the-american-fascist/), the [brazen, hateful attacks](http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2016/11/13/a_list_of_racist_incidents_across_the_united_states_since_donald_trump_was.html) that are a hallmark of too many of Trump's supporters, and the [candid threats to journalists](http://edition.cnn.com/2015/12/21/politics/trump-putin-killing-reporters/index.html) and those who would hold a Trump administration accountable. 

Trump isn't even president yet, but his election has already exposed and validated so much that's wrong with our country.

Frankly, we had a big problem well before the election. This book was published in 2004; I just found out about it recently, [thanks to Mandy Brown](http://aworkinglibrary.com/editor/jennifer-harvey/): 

[![Disrupting White Supremacy from Within](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61oWLi%2BzrnL.jpg)](https://www.amazon.com/Disrupting-Supremacy-Within-Jennifer-Harvey/dp/0829816070/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1483772472&sr=1-2)

I'm reading it now.

The fact that this book has to exist is unfortunate enough; the fact that it's as relevant as it's ever been is terrifying.

Perhaps more terrifying is [the collective rejection of and hostility toward indisputable climate science](http://www.climatecentral.org/news/trump-cabinet-climate-change-20920) from Trump's proposed cabinet. 

We just don't have time for this bullshit.

It turns out we need _more_ words. In particular, we need words that aren't generated in an ad-funded bullshit factory. We need words that demonstrate genuine care for others, a commitment to facts and research, a reverence for life and diversity, and an acknowledgement that we are truly in a dangerous time.

So I will write. I will write about politics, books, film, and the web. I will write because it's integral to exercising democratic freedom. I will write to resist. And I will write to avoid complacency.
