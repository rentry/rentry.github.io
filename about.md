## Words and maps

Iâ€™m a web editor and digital strategist living in Portland, Oregon. 

I specialize in public sector web content strategy, editorial standards, and accessibility. I produce style guides, policy, and strategy that recognize the unique challenges and opportunities of digital communications in government. Mostly, I make sure words do their job.

I am also a map geek, which inspired me to earn a graduate certificate in Geographic Information Science. As a result, I have experience in remote sensing, Python programming, and spatial analysis. 

In the past, I worked in the non-profit sector, primarily in watershed protection, restoration and education. I remain committed to causes that promote watershed health and protection. 

Apart from these pursuits, I spend as much time as possible in the woods and around the campfire with my wife and two dogs.
