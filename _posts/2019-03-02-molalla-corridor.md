description: "I don’t often blog about walking in the woods. In the past, I posted such self-indulgent, albeit personally necessary, excursions to social media. But I no longer subscribe to most social media, so I’ll share my walks here, starting with a walk to Annie’s Cabin near Molalla, Oregon."

I fled the [clusterfuck known as Facebook]({{ site.baseurl }}/leaving-facebook/) almost two years ago, and I reluctantly deleted Instagram from my phone last year. Consequently, I have limited digital avenues by which to share the kinds of things we humans tend to share with each other.

I’ve gone on ad nauseum about social media, so I won’t do it again (although [Facebook continues to demonstrate its disgraceful disregard for privacy](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/some-apps-send-data-about-menstruation-home-buying-facebook-wsj-n974711)). Talking about and sharing photos from walks stretches the theme of this blog, but, let’s face it: this blog has been off the rails the whole time. There never were rails.

## Walking

I’m not quite right in the head unless I walk. I must walk. And I prefer to walk among the trees.

The Clackamas River basin has been my walking venue of choice in the past, but lately we’ve been walking in the nearby [Molalla Corridor](https://www.blm.gov/documents/oregon-washington/public-room/map/oregon-molalla-river). It’s public land (owned and managed by the Bureau of Land Management, on behalf of the people of the United States), and it is special.

We’ve walked in the corridor many times, from the [AmeriCorps Trail](https://www.blm.gov/visit/molalla) to the [Table Rock Wilderness](https://www.blm.gov/programs/national-conservation-lands/oregon-washington/table-rock-wilderness).

These days, we opt for relatively flat, short trails that our 14 year-old Golden Retriever can handle without subsequent crippling soreness. The Molalla Corridor is packed with loops and contours that let us moderate his exertion.

Today, we walked to Annie’s Cabin (a cabin for which there is a story I won’t tell here).

I’ll try to include more recaps of my walks, as winter turns to spring.
