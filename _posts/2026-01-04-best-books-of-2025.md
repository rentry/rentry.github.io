[As with last year]({{ '/best-books-of-2023/' | relative_url }}), this list isn’t composed only of books _released_ in 2025. It’s a list of my favorite books I read this year, regardless of when the book was published. Also, this list doesn’t include books I _reread_ this year, only those books I read for the first time.

Honorable mentions this year include <cite>Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism</cite>, <cite>Heartwood</cite>, <cite>Dirtbag Billionaire: How Yvon Chouinard Built Patagonia, Made a Fortune, and Gave It All Away</cite>, <cite>A Life Wild and Perilous: Mountain Men and the Paths to the Pacific</cite>, and <cite>The Children of Men</cite> (the adaptation of which is among my all-time favorite films).

{% for entry in site.data.books.list %}
{% if entry.year == 2025 %}
{% assign bookYear = entry.year %}
{% assign bookSize = entry.books | size %}
[I read {{ bookSize }} books in {{ bookYear }}]({{ site.baseurl }}/books#{{bookYear}}-books). Here are my 10 favorite books I read (or listened to) this year.
