_This post is for RSS subscribers only._

This is my first post available only to RSS subscribers. I have no idea if any such subscribers exist, and I have no way to track them if they do. I've [disabled tracking on my website]({{ '/no-google-tracking/' | relative_url }}) and have no in interest nor method for tracking RSS subscribers, should you exist.

Ironically, my first RSS-only post is about my personal website, a visit to which is unnecessary when using an RSS reader (although I recently changed my feed to only supply a summary of each post, a decision I gather might be anathema to RSS purists).

But I digress. About my website.

I built my first personal website in 2004. I had just graduated from college and took a job at a general store in the Beartooth Mountains of Montana. Outside of alpine general stores, my career prospects were limited, graduating as I did in philosophy and religious studies.

In a modest cabin in Montana, I built a simple website with table layouts, poor usability, and egregious ignorance of accessibility. But I had a way to share my experience in the mountains, with absolutely no ambition, monetization, or trolling. Smartphones didn't exist. Social media was mercifully yet to emerge in any meaningful way. The stakes were low, but publishing a blog still felt like a miracle.

The early internet was my favorite internet, by far.

![A blog post from 2005 that contains two photos, one of a black bear in the distance and one of a golden retriever dog with a poppy flower, the post reads i must apologize for this miserable photograph of wally, our diminutive black bear, but he was a good 30 feet away, and had just been shot in the ass]({{ 'assets/images/2023-old-blog-post.png' | relative_url }})

Nearly 20 years later, my blog posts still aren't about my career (mostly) or designed to be monetized.

## Why my personal website (still) isn't about my career

To get this out of the way, I recognize having a personal website is a privilege, and having a personal website that isn't focused on career self-promotion is also a privilege. Not to mention that I've learned a lot from the many personal websites that are largely focused on authors' paid work.

That said, most of the personal websites I come across are career focused, self-promotional, or otherwise myopically oriented toward monetizing someone's carefully curated personal "brand". 

I suspect this is, perhaps obviously, the result of capitalism's emphasis on competition, with successful job seeking and career enhancement conditioned in large part by how well one packages and sells oneself. And social media, along with diminishing the need for and purposes of many personal websites, has provided outlets for personal expression and communication that are better optimized for reach than personal websites.

As a result, it seems many people, especially those in the "tech sector", have decided that personal websites are best used for career self promotion.

I've never seriously considered using my personal website as an elaborate résumé. It's not that I don't _ever_ write about my job; [I do occasionally write about work]({{ '/writing-in-legal-context' | relative_url }}) I do in the course of my job. But I have no interest in defining my public persona exclusively in the context of my job. It seems to me a waste of a personal website to share only that which is largely controlled outside of one's own intention, as most career choices are (even if we think we're controlling them).

There is an argument, of course, that one's personal life and interests are private and the only public expression one feels compelled to share is one's career. I'm sympathetic to that argument, thought the perceptive result seems to be our collective reduction to economic and societal cogs.

This post is, of course, reductive, and in that way embodies what it criticizes. But I do encourage you, if anyone is reading this, to share more about your life than just how brilliant you are at your job. Because personal websites are awesome, and using them to describe a job that will probably be obsolete in 5 years is just too basic for you, no matter how amazing you are at your job.
