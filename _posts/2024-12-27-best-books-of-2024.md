[As with last year]({{ '/best-books-of-2023/' | relative_url }}), this list isn’t composed only of books _released_ in 2024. It’s a list of my favorite books among those I read this year, regardless of when the book was published. Also, this list doesn’t include books I _reread_ this year, only those books I read for the first time.

For the first time in 2024, I started rating each book with ★s. I did so immediately when I finished the book, and consequently, the ★ ratings don't completely align with ranking below. That's in part because the real-time ratings didn't factor in the reading list in totality.

{% for entry in site.data.books.list %}
{% if entry.year == 2024 %}
{% assign bookYear = entry.year %}
{% assign bookSize = entry.books | size %}
[I read {{ bookSize }} books in {{ bookYear }}]({{ site.baseurl }}/books#{{bookYear}}-books). Here are my 10 favorite books I read (or listened to) this year.

## 10: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.ynharari.com/book/nexus/">Nexus: A Brief History of Information Networks from the Stone Age to AI</a>
As the title suggests, Harari addresses (and challenges) AI from the perspective of the anthropological history of human information networks. This is as fertile grounding as any, I suppose, but another book in this list provides a simultaneously broader and more specific justification to question AI. That said, this book—along with the author's previously earned notoriety—is a vital contribution to the discourse regarding AI.

## 9: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/250093.Walking_It_Off">Walking It Off: A Veteran’s Chronicle of War and Wilderness</a>
As the inspiration for Edward Abbey's Hayduke in <cite>The Monkey Wrench Gang</cite>, Doug Peacock certainly has tales to tell. After reading Peacock's more recent <cite>Was It Worth It?</cite> in 2022, I looked back to this book, published in 1997. Its portrayal of the author's post-traumatic return from Vietnam, along with a raw recounting of his relationship with Abbey, this book is laden with sobering perspective.

## 8: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.mountaineers.org/books/books/arctic-traverse-a-thousand-mile-summer-of-trekking-the-brooks-range">Arctic Traverse: A Thousand-Mile Summer of Trekking the Brooks Range</a>
I always appreciate a wilderness travel memoir, and this book is no exception. Its envy-inducing Alaska adventure, along with the author's obvious admiration for his surroundings—both human and non-human—make this a rewarding read.

## 7: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50364458-the-tyranny-of-merit">The Tyranny of Merit: What's Become of the Common Good?</a>
"Success" resulting from merit seems like a noble, democracy-supporting idea, in theory. But as the author demonstrates, the entire justification for class hierarchy based on merit not only betrays a clearly stacked deck, but is a flawed idea to begin with.  

## 6: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/brian-merchant/blood-in-the-machine/9780316487740/?lens=little-brown">Blood in the Machine: The Origins of the Rebellion Against Big Tech</a>
It's time to take back the term "Luddite".

## 5: <a class="book-title" href="https://books.catapult.co/books/the-age-of-deer/">The Age of Deer: Trouble and Kinship with our Wild Neighbors</a>
I picked up this book randomly from a bookstore at the Oregon Coast, and I was immediately enthralled. The book captures our societies' complex relationship with deer, and humanity's ancient fascination with these animals.

## 4: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/606856/worn-by-sofi-thanhauser/">Worn: A People’s History of Clothing</a>
I learned of this book while watching Patagonia's excellent short film [<cite>The Shitthropocene</cite>](https://www.patagonia.com/stories/the-shitthropocene/video-150905.html). It's an excellent anthropological survey of clothing and an appeal for us to recognize the cultural and environment web of past and present relationships embodied in our fabrics and clothing. 

## 3: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/609280/a-swim-in-a-pond-in-the-rain-by-george-saunders/">A Swim in a Pond in the Rain: In Which Four Russians Give a Master Class on Writing, Reading, and Life</a>
I listened to this audiobook, and it's like being in George Saunders class. Saunders guides the reader through classic short stories, heightening awareness, attention, and thoughtfulness.

## 2: <a class="book-title" href="https://kristinhannah.com/books/the-women/">The Women</a>
I don't think I've ever teared up while reading a book, but I did with this one.

## 1: <a class="book-title" href="https://www.robinwallkimmerer.com/books">The Serviceberry: Abundance and Reciprocity in the Natural World</a>
Like <cite>Braiding Sweetgrass</cite> before it, this is a book our society desperately needs. I originally listened to the (brief) audiobook, but received the printed book as a gift for Christmas. The latter is full of beautiful illustrations, accompanying beautiful text.
