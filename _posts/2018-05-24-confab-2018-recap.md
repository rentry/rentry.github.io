description: This was my second Confab conference, and it felt (once again) unique among conferences. Confab is special, because Confab is thoughtful.

I just returned from [Confab](https://www.confabevents.com/) in Minneapolis. I last attended Confab (in its “Intensive” format) in Portland back in 2015. This year, Confab confirmed it’s different than any other conference I’ve been to.

Don’t get me wrong, Confab – like all conferences – is at times reminiscent of high school, with its cliques and social hierarchies. (All conferences thrive off of the exclusivity of hierarchies; if every conference attendee is understood to have the same level of knowledge and expertise, why would anyone attend a presentation by someone else?)

Confab’s attendees are some of the best people I’ve met. As a result, Confab is a unique conference. Those drawn to content strategy are disproportionately empathetic, well-read, and motivated, which makes for a comfortable, interesting conference experience.

## Confab is thoughtful

Confab is, in a word, _thoughtful_. From the swag bags to the dedicated introverts’ room (a different kind of “escape room”), the Confab team is considerate, empathetic, and anticipatory. And fun, of course.

<p style="font-size: .6em; text-align: center;">Confab swag included colored pencils in a box (with a ruler lid), an activity book, and socks(!), among other good stuff.</p>

The thoughtfulness extended beyond the planning and into the sessions (and, hopefully, our work). Two opening-day talks set out major themes for the week:

* [Inclusive content, ethical tech, and you](https://www.confabevents.com/2018-sessions/inclusive-content-ethical-tech-and-you)
* [Speaking truth to power: How to build equity through writing and design standards](https://www.confabevents.com/2018-sessions/speaking-truth-to-power-how-to-build-equity-through-writing-and-design-standards)

## Takeaways

* I tend to limit the number of documents I create and impose on my team members, but I learned at this conference that each tool and resulting artifact surfaces the work and demonstrates the collaborative and intentional process behind strategic recommendations. The artifacts aren’t annoying; they’re integral.
* Breaking pieces of content down to reveal each respective attribute can help with content meaning and organization. Sometimes these attributes are implicit, but they should be articulated and agreed upon. Malaika Carpenter’s talk [_Solo content strategy: Lessons for lone rangers and tiny teams_](https://www.confabevents.com/2018-sessions/solo-content-strategy-lessons-for-lone-rangers-and-tiny-teams) was excellent, and covered this process for those working alone or on small teams.
* I first read [How to Make Sense of Any Mess](http://www.howtomakesenseofanymess.com/) over a year ago, but author Abby Covert’s talk [_Language: Your organization’s most important and least valued asset_](https://www.confabevents.com/2018-sessions/language-your-organizations-most-important-and-least-valued-asset) drove home the (informative) distinction between _content_ and _information_ articulated in her book. To put it simply, content is what we can control as structured, _intended_ meaning; information is what the audience interprets from that content. Our work is focused on designing the content in such a way as to promote understanding, but “content” and “information” are not synonymous.
