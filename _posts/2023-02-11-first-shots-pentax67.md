It took nearly a month, but I finally received from the lab my first photos [shot with the Pentax 6ùóë7]({{ '/camera-pentax-67/' | relative_url }}).

My first photos with this camera are on black and white Ilford HP5 400, and‚Äîdespite having picked up yellow #15 and red #25 filters for just this purpose‚ÄîI omitted filters for these first shots to get a sense of how the camera performs without them.

I still have a lot to learn about this camera. It requires a tremendous amount of light to prevent the enormous mirror from creating vibration blur (one reason why the mirror lock-up version of this camera is absolutely necessary), and I was shooting under cloud cover deep in a forest.

But overall, I'm happy with these first images. It's been a long time since I've shot medium format, and the relative quality of the resulting images compared to 35mm is unmistakeable.

I'm going to try Kodak Ektar 100 color film next, but I might have to wait for Oregon's famous blanket of grey to recede to get sufficient light for ISO 100. I might try [pushing film](https://thedarkroom.com/pushing-and-pulling-film/) in this camera given its limitations in low light.
