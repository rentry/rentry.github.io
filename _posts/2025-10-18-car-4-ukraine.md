As I walked to a small "No Kings" rally at my local country church this morning with a hastily written homemade sign that read *CHRISTIAN NATIONALISM IS UNBIBLICAL AND UNAMERICAN*, I considered my recently established goal—crucial to my precarious mental health—to be more content with small contributions in our collective fight against authoritarianism at home and abroad.

In nerdier contemplation, I recalled Gandalf's speech regarding the hobbits Merry and Pippin, and their (somewhat accidental) role in inspiring and catalyzing the Ents to resist the destruction of Fangorn Forest, and the associated, subjugating authoritarianism of Saruman and Sauron.

> “Their coming was like the falling of small stones that starts an avalanche in the mountains.”

While I was at the church, I learned that some church members were hauling wood from a nearby downed tree, cutting it into sections to provide firewood for needy neighbors this winter (the church also has a well-stocked food pantry). Putting my signs aside after the first hour of the rally, I spent the remaining time moving and splitting firewood, knowing that it would keep a neighbor's family warm over the next several months.

Earlier in the week, I saw evidence of another small stone I cast into the world, this time in Ukraine. In a weekly video from [Car for Ukraine](https://car4ukraine.com/), I saw my name on the side of a truck I helped fund via the [50 States for Ukraine campaign](https://car4ukraine.com/campaigns/50forua). The refurbished and armored truck will be sent to the front line to support troops fighting against the devastating, criminal Russian invasion.

I continue to feel that my meager contributions are catastrophically insufficient. But all I have are small stones, and can only hope there are enough of them from enough of us to cause an avalanche in the mountains.
