I've been visiting [Silver Falls State Park](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=151) almost annually for over a decade. It's my favorite place in Oregon.

While the [Trail of Ten Falls hike](https://www.oregonhikers.org/field_guide/Trail_of_Ten_Falls_Loop_Hike) is the main attraction for most people (I've hiked it three times), it's closed to dogs, and consequently off limits for me on most of my trips to the park.

But that's okay; the main trail's popularity means the remaining 35 miles of backcountry trails in the park are largely vacant.

We've winter camped here for years, usually in one of the pet-friendly rustic cabins. The cabins lack a bathroom, kitchen, and other amenities, but they're warm and quaint (there are some "deluxe" cabins with those amenities, but most of them prohibit pets, and they're more competitive to book).

This year, we were back for a short trip for my birthday, and the park was reliably stunning. We've never stayed at the park in the autumn, and the fall foliage was breathtaking.

My wife gifted me a plant press for my birthday this year, and I put it to immediate use, capturing ferns, vine maple, cascara, oxalis, and others.

We cooked on a simple Coleman propane grill and directly over the campfire. To have a true camping experience—meaning with a campfire—in the west these days, one has to camp in the shoulder seasons or in winter, since climate change has resulted in perpetual, unrelenting wildfires in the summer. Campfires are banned for just about all of the summer now, and for good reason.[^1] 

[^1]: We don't camp in the summer anymore, as we abandoned our last attempt after a 5-hour drive because two wildfires were converging on our reserved campsite and the smoke was intolerable. We last camped in summer in 2020, almost exactly one month before the campground and everything around it was annihilated by the Labor Day wildfires (which also led to our evacuation of our home for a week).

We took leisurely hikes between four and nine miles each day, all in the park's backcountry. In the afternoons, we read books and tended the campfire, even through intermittent rain showers.

This park is special. The combination of history, natural beauty, and recreational options is unmatched in Oregon, in my opinion. I'll keep coming back to the “crown jewel” of the Oregon State Parks system.
