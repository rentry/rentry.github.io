In one of my favorite TV shows in the last 20 years – the excellent reboot of [<cite>Battlestar Galactica</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battlestar_Galactica) – the titular starship eludes the destruction of the rest of the fleet on account of its analog operating systems. The ship's archaic technology (the ship is literally a museum of deprecated technology in the pilot episode) means that it evades the hostile, debilitating malware attack perpetrated by the Cylons, the AI race of machines that wage war on their human creators.

Not to get too tin-foil-hat about it, but we've entered a period in which technology is largely serving ends that are no longer benefiting individual people, society, or the environment; in fact, its actively harming all three.

I don't really have time to, nor do I want to, recount all of the ways in which technology truly sucks now. We should all, at this point, be familiar with [surveillance capitalism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surveillance_capitalism), the [unconscionable environmental impacts of technology](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/03/ai-water-climate-microsoft/677602/) when we can least afford it, the [despotic inclinations of tech "leaders"](https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/02/despots-silicon-valley/677386/), the [techno-capitalist comfort with teen suicide](https://www.forbes.com/sites/zakdoffman/2019/01/27/instagram-implicated-in-teen-suicides-just-as-facebook-bets-its-future-on-the-platform/?sh=1d4b058d5a80), and so much more. What are we doing?

## I'm a Luddite now

Most of my time at work now is spent _resisting_ technology fixes, rather than embracing them.

For example, in a recent team meeting, my boss introduced the idea of "working on something related to AI." Now, this on its own is certainly not unusual in tech right now, but our team in government was created two years ago to identify and solve service delivery problems through digital interactions. If you introduce a technology, completely agnostic to the problem that technology is intended to solve, you've already failed. Or rather, your choice of technology is agnostic to the problem you're supposedly trying to address.

And that seems to be where we're at...a solution absent a problem. Furthermore, artificial intelligence and machine learning models are trained on _existing_ content and patterns. Frankly, we haven't collectively built equitable, socially conscious, plain-language content and services up until this point, so why would we think AI will do better, if we understand the technology sufficiently to know that it's trained on our existing bullshit?

### Beyond absurd

Most technological innovations these days seem to be some version of the laughably absurd phenomenon of NFT (non-fungible tokens). NFTs are the epitome of what Marx referred to as exchange value over use value; that is, manufactured "value" devoid of any real-world purpose.

But it's not just NFTs and other crypto-derived nonsense; it's also everyday technological upgrades with no real value or purpose.

Take the [article from <cite>The Atlantic</cite>](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/02/4k-tv-resolution-lie/677586/) which (rightly) points out that 4K TV resolution is a complete sham. As pointed out in the article:

> According to the many TV-size-to-distance calculators available online, when you’re sitting on a couch a dozen feet from your television, a 65-inch screen will look the same whether it’s HD or 4K. The latter has more pixels, but your eyes won’t pick them up. You’ll never know the difference. For the picture to look much better—for you to “see” the benefits of modern ultra-high resolution—you’d need to upgrade to a preposterously large screen, more than 100 inches in diagonal.

_Your eyes can't even resolve the added detail of 4K._ So again, what are we doing?

### Simple, analog, reliable

I suppose I have been a Luddite for quite awhile, to be honest. I've never hailed an Uber (literally never had the app on my phone, which is probably good, since they [kept tracking your data _even if you deleted the app_](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/uber-broke-app-store-policies-deleted-apps)). Uber, like many tech companies, just insisted on being socially sketchy and destructive by [bypassing regulations, perhaps most notably here in the Portland](https://www.opb.org/news/article/portland-oregon-investigation-uber-greyball/).

I suppose I do have a low tolerance for capitalism's catastrophic capture of tech, having [quit Facebook in 2017]({{ '/leaving-facebook' | realtive_url }}), Instagram a year later, and [Twitter when that rich asshole bought it]({{ '/here-we-go-again' | realtive_url }}).

To extend the theme of creepy surveillance issues with vehicles, Ford (the disgusting legacy of which I alluded to in [my last post about Jeeps]({{ '/jeep-catalog' | relative_url }})) is planning to [make more revenue from selling the personal data](https://www.freep.com/story/money/cars/2018/11/13/ford-motor-credit-data-new-revenue/1967077002/) from vehicle financing and driving data than from the vehicles themselves.

This is truly dystopian late-stage capitalism, and technology is its vanguard.

If you've been reading this blog, you know that I largely lean away from digital in my daily life, preferring [film cameras]({{ '/camera-pentax-67' | relative_url }}) to digital, and [20 year-old trucks to new ones]({{ '/joining-search-and-rescue-part-3' | relative_url }}) (the perhaps cheesy subheading `digital work / analog life` still adorns the header of this website).

My old truck is a useful example of the reliability of simple, analog solutions. When I bought it, I insisted on a manual transmission and manual windows and door locks. My wife, whose vehicle is furnished with electric windows and door locks, scoffed at the idea at the time, and found humorous the gymnastics involved with stretching across the truck to roll down the passenger-side window.

![A water bottle, a vehicle seat, and a manual transmission rod, with gloves]({{ 'assets/images/2024-truck-3.jpg' | relative_url }}#float)

That was until one of the electric windows in her own (mostly reliable) vehicle failed, and the window can no longer be rolled down. My manual window cranks? Still working perfectly, over 20 years later.

The same is the case for my truck's stereo. It is stock, simple, and I haven't even considered replacing it. I have replaced too many stock car stereos in the past to count, but I never once considered replacing this one in 2018, when I bought the truck. It of course lacks CarPlay, bluetooth, a digital display, or even auxiliary plugins. But it works! And it even plays compact discs, which, on account of my age, I have _many_.

![A vehicle radio that reads 9:33 on a display, with numberous buttons for presets, volume, etc., and a transmitter device reading 87.7 in blue light, with dials for temperature below]({{ 'assets/images/2024-truck-2.jpg' | relative_url }}#full)

I do, of course, occasionally want to use bluetooth with my truck stereo to play audiobooks, podcasts, or playlists. For that, I have a rudimentary technology I also had for my Sony Discman back in the 90s: a radio transmitter. Is it perfect? No. But it does it just work? Absolutely.

The best part? Almost everything is easily repaired, simple in both mechanics and use. And, should I turn off my phone, there's not a single device tracking me. I can live with the inconvenience of moving my arm to move a window for that peace of mind.
