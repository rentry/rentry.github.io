I'm not sure why, but I have recently been obsessed with the history of the World War II jeep. Perhaps it's because I've been watching [<cite>Masters of the Air</cite>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masters_of_the_Air), or perhaps because I have an unfortunate [obsession with trucks in general]({{ '/joining-search-and-rescue-part-3/' | relative_url }}).

I won't go into the drama of the three companies involved (Bantam, Willys, Ford...but spoiler, Bantam–which no longer exists–was the best, whose prototypes were made public domain), and how the WW2 jeep came to be, but it is a _fascinating_ story of a simple little truck that had an outsized influence on the outcome of history's most notorious war.[^1]

As it turns out, I—like many of my advancing age—had a grandfather whose service in the Army Air Corps united an entire country around a common cause. That commitment still stands as an emblem of solidarity that seems impossibly antiquated now, but I have in safe keeping my grandfather's wool shirts (with accompanying patches) to remind me of said solidarity and sacrifice. Once upon a time.

## My shitty Jeep

After I moved from Montana back to Oregon, I drove a Jeep Wrangler YJ, and frankly, it was the least reliable vehicle I've ever owned (to be fair, it did make the trek between the two states multiple times...but the engine also literally just stopped running at random times—including in midtraffic—and wouldn't restart).

I can attest that it was an unbelievably fun vehicle to drive, and I still miss the joy to this day.

## Guiding a Jeep cover photo

Back in 2005, I was living in the Beartooth mountains of Montana, having just graduated from the University of Oregon.

At the time, I was working at a mountain store that was the gateway for adventures into the backcountry of the Beartooth Wilderness. The scout for the contracted Jeep team (pre-Stallantis, I guess? I don't research capitalist bullshit) did his job, finding this remote place with a basecamp, but they nonetheless needed my lightweight tripod to convey their kit into the backcountry, and a guide to lead them into the Beartooth Wilderness.

And that's how, in 2015, my tripod, along with my trail guidance, led to the cover photo for the 2016 Jeep catalog...

The summer of 2015 in the Beartooth Mountains was full of stories, and I do have a (very old) blog that recounts some of them, but those are for some other time (or a smaller audience).

There are, indeed, more stories to tell about this particular trip, but I think I'll keep them to myself. I do hope that the team found their true base camp with one another, nearly 20 years later.
