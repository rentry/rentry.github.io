We were back in the Molalla Corridor for today’s walk. Our route took us on multiple trails: Hardy Creek → Huckleberry → Loop → Fern Creek → Elk Run.

Perfect spring weather greeted us, and we were mostly alone on the trails.

## Location
The Hardy Creek Trailhead is among the most used in the corridor, perhaps because it is centrally located between the South and North extents of the trail, and it offers double-track, road-width trails for horses.
