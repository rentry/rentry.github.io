I've written previously about my [complicated feelings about my home state]({{ 'about-wyoming' | relative_url }}), but my parents just moved back to Wyoming, and I'm heading there for a week of mountain air and a [nerdy book and TV series festival](https://www.longmiredays.com/).

I'll be off the grid much of the week, as I'll be spending some quality time in both the Wind River and Bighorn mountain ranges, but I'll try to check in here during the week.

I haven't visited Wyoming in about a decade, so we'll see how it goes. I'm excited to explore some places I either missed or took for granted in my youth.
