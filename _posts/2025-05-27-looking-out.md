Starting today, I have a [little more time on my hands]({{ 'big-changes/' | relative_url }}), at least for a few weeks. So Teddy and I decided to take a drive and hike up to Pechuck Lookout, a rare stone fire lookout near the Table Rock Wilderness south of where I live.

We arrived to an empty parking area, and we didn't see another person during the hike or at the lookout.

I last visited the lookout in 2019, prior to the [massive Labor Day wildfires](https://brentryanjohnson.com/notes-from-evacuation/) of 2020. I was relieved to learn in 2022 that the [lookout had survived the fires](https://brentryanjohnson.com/cherish-what-survives/), albeit barely. 

Evidence of the 2020 Beachie Creek fire was pervasive, with remnants of the burn leading nearly to the front door of the lookout.

I used the new [Goat Maps](https://www.goatmaps.com/) app to track my hike, and it has a useful layer indicating and labeling the boundaries of historic wildfires.

My last hike here was also in May, earlier in the month, and I ended up negotiating a fair amount of snow in a few areas. This time, there was no sign of remaining snow, and the sides of the trail were laden with a variety of wildflowers.

It's not a long hike to the lookout from the Rooster Rock trailhead, but you feel the climb at the beginning.

You can take a short spur to visit said Rooster Rock, and a longer effort to Table Rock to the north. Near the lookout, the view opens up to reveal Table Rock in the distance, as well as Mount Hood between some of the burned trees.

I've lost a lot that I care about recently; it's good to be reminded of what survivesâ€”and to cherish it.
