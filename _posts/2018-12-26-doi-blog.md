I’ve been furloughed as part of the government shutdown, but I’d to share what I _was_ working on before the shutdown. I recently finished building the [team’s blog](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/blog/) in [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), and the first two posts document the research, design, and development process for rebuilding the site’s homepage and transitioning the codebase to Gatsby.

- [**How we rebuilt our open-data homepage part two: development**](https://revenuedata.doi.gov/blog/homepage-revamp-part-two/)

I’ll try to get back to my series on content architecture over the next two weeks.
