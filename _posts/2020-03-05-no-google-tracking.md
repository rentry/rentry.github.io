I’m terrified by the scope of [surveillance capitalism](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2019/jan/20/shoshana-zuboff-age-of-surveillance-capitalism-google-facebook). And yet, I’ve had Google Analytics on this site from the beginning.

Not anymore. I’m removing all tracking from this site (at least that which is under my control). I don’t want your visit tracked by anyone, anymore.

There’s no reason, outside of my own curiosity, to track you. But by using Google Analytics, I’m exposing your visit to Google, too. I don’t want to do that. I don’t want to make that decision for you. And I don’t know what they’re up to.

So whomever you are, from wherever you came, I won’t know _anything_ about you or what you looked at here. I hope you found something of value.
