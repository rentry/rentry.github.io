Back in June, I interviewed to join [Clackamas County Search & Rescue](https://www.clackamas.us/sheriff/sar.html), a volunteer team coordinated through the Sheriff’s Office. The team is relatively new, resulting as it did from [a controversial consolidation of volunteer teams](https://www.opb.org/news/article/clackamas-county-sheriffs-department-defends-search-and-rescue-changes/) in 2020. As a result of this consolidation, volunteers are now required to participate in extensive background checks, drug testing, training, and certification.

## Training
### CPR, First Aid, and FEMA Incident Command
My training began with CPR/First Aid and [FEMA Incident Command](https://training.fema.gov/emiweb/is/icsresource/trainingmaterials/). Having previously working in the Public Information Office of Clackamas County, I had already taken several of the required FEMA classes. You'll see these requirements under `J- Additional Qualifications` below.

I submitted to drug testing and passed the required background check.

Simultaneous to the background check and required training, we began fitness testing and field training in August.

### Field training
I participated in four field trainings over 7 weekend days between August and October. All but one were on Mt. Hood, as several search and rescue missions happen on the mountain, furnishing a realistic venue for training (2 of the 7 days had overlapping, actual search-and-rescue missions).

Accompanied by our 113-page training manual, we received field instruction in everything from wilderness first aid to land navigation. For our final weekend in October, we were required to demonstrate the skills we learned, with no help from our trainers. 

As you'll discover below, search and rescue certification can become a full-time job...

#### A -- SURVIVAL SKILLS & EQUIPMENT (Types 1-3) TASK
   
1. Where land use rules and the environment allow, build a fire using materials found in the field and carried in a mission ready pack/kit. The fire must be constructed in a manner that will provide personal warmth; or team warmth; or warmth for a found subject for 8 to 12 hours.

11. Demonstrate the ability to navigate in a straight line (using compass) for 500 meters with no more than four (4) degrees of deviation.
12. Demonstrate the ability to navigate (by compass & pacing) between four (4) selected points in your primary search area for a minimum distance of 1 kilometer with no more than 40 meters of deviation from the final point.
13. Demonstrate the ability to navigate around an obstacle blocking your selected path while staying on course.
14. Demonstrate the ability to determine distance traveled by using their 100-meter pace. 
15. Demonstrate the ability to navigate in a straight line (using compass) for 500 meters with no more than four (4) degrees of deviation at night. (+- 2 degrees of center or 18m from target)

#### D -- GPS OPERATIONS (Types 1-4)

1. Change the batteries of a GPS receiver. (Team & Personal)
2. Turn on a GPS and acquire a coordinate that accurately
represents their location.
3. Change coordinate system setting within a GPS unit.
4. Change the datum setting in a GPS unit
5. Ability to switch between kilometers/meters and miles/feet

6. Set their GPS for true north.
7. Mark, edit, view and delete a waypoint in a GPS receiver.
8. Clear, start, and save a GPS track that records your
movement over at least 500 meters.
9. Create a route with at least four legs in a GPS unit and
follow it to its end.
10. Use a GPS unit to convert a coordinate from UTM to lat
long.
11. Use a GPS unit to convert a coordinate from lat long to
UTM.
12. Use a GPS to triangulate your position on a map with no coordinate system using two known points (with their coordinates) on the map as waypoints. (1 through 11 will satisfy #12)

#### E -- SEARCH TECHNIQUES (Types 1-3)

1. Determine searcher spacing in at least two different environments, i.e. wooded and open areas.
2. Demonstrate effective searching;
  - Establish a search route in a wooded environment that is at least 50 yards long. Personnel must estimate their sweep width (for an adult size target). In this search area, randomly place one adult prone subject and between 9 and 12 clothing objects of various size. Given 10 min to search the area, the personnel must locate the adult, and a reasonable percentage of the other items (30%-50%).
  - Establish a search area in a grassy field (approximately 1-2 inch-high grass), about 14x50 feet in size. In this search area, randomly place 20 small items such as shell casings. Given 10 min to search, the personnel is expected to find 15 items.

3. Assess the features of a search area such as terrain, vegetation, and boundaries and determine a reasonable search tactic for that area to achieve their assigned goals.

### Written test

Along with field demonstrations, we were also required to complete a written test with over 100 questions. We were required to achieve at least an 80% score on the test, issued by the Oregon State Sheriff's Association.

## Gear

I plan to write a separate, detailed post on gear, but for now I'll provide our required gear list. As volunteers, we're required to procure and carry this gear ourselves, with the Sheriff's Office providing the [litters](https://cascade-rescue.com/cascade-rescue-professional-series-steel-rescue-litter/), [SKEDs](https://skedco.com/product/sked-basic-rescue-system-international-orange/), and a limited number of radios.

Our gear list is split into two packs: 24-hour and "Hasty". The 24-hour pack is exactly what is sounds like; it contains gear necessary to provision one's self for a 24-hour period (and respond to the needs of a subject). The "hasty" pack is intended for short-term searches, such as when the subject of the search is likely to be in a confined area or along a well-marked trail.

Again, I'll go into this in more detail. But given the hasty pack is a subset of the 24-hour pack, I have mine organized such that the hasty gear is organized into two compartments that I can include in my 24-hour pack, but are removable and can be mounted on a separate harness.

### Required gear

<table style="width: 100%; table-layout: fixed; margin-bottom: 2em;">
    <tbody>
        <thead>
                <th style="text-align: left; width: 5em;"><strong>24-hour</strong></th>
                <th style="text-align: left; width: 5em;"><strong>Hasty</strong></th>
                <th style="text-align: left;"><strong>Gear</strong></th>
        </thead>    
    {% for gear in site.data.csar-gear-list %}   
        <tr>
            <td style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: none; width: 5em;">{{ gear.hasty }}</td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: none; width: 5em;">{{ gear.twenty-four }}</td>
            <td style="vertical-align: top; border-bottom: none;">{{ gear.gear }}</td>
        </tr>
    {% endfor %}    
    </tbody>    
</table>

Notably, we were required to obtain all the gear and undergo a pack check before we could respond to missions. That meant (1) we couldn't take advantage of gear discounts for SAR members, because we were not yet members and (2) we didn't yet know exactly which versions of each item would be optimal. I've discovered in just a few weeks that trading out and replacing gear will be a constant.

There's _a lot_ more to share, including:

- Why I joined search and rescue
- Detailed pack list
- My first few missions
- Requirements to remain operational (notable, because I have a shoulder surgery coming up)

I'll try to share more over the next few weeks. If there's anything you'd like to know about my search and rescue experience, [message me on this bird thing](https://twitter.com/forestglenroad).
