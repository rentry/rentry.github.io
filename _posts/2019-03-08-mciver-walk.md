Today's short walk was along a road and horse trails in McIver State Park, a location where we often walk. There was a frisbee golf tournament (McIver is known for its frisbee golf course) at the north end of the park, our usual destination, so we opted for the southern end's horse trails.

## Location
The horse trails along Estacada Lake are in McIver State Park at the southern extent. One can park at Estacada Lake, in the nearby campground, or at the horse camp.
