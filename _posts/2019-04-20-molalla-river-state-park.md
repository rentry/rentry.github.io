Today's walk was through a state park where the Molalla River drains into the Willamette River near Canby, Oregon. The Molalla River State Park is a beautiful place, tucked in between farms and forests, where the sky always seems to be a little more dramatic than anywhere around it.

## Location
Molalla River State Park is a frequent destination for us. And while we have an Oregon State Parks vehicle pass, this park is free without it. There's an off-leash area for dogs, a boat ramp to the Willamette River, and a network of trails along the river bank.
