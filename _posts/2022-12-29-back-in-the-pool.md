I've been swimming since I can remember. I couldn't float as a child, so teaching me to swim early was a priority for my parents. As a result, I started swimming competitively around age six.

I swam through high school, and later contemplated swimming in college. I opted for water polo instead, with a club team at the University of Oregon (our team had the "pleasure" of getting our asses kicked by a team led by former Olympian and world record holder [Tom Jager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tom_Jager)).

I've been swimming off and on as my primary exercise ever since. But when the pandemic closed gyms and pools everywhere, I took up mountain biking. It didn't go so well, as I crashed my bike in November 2020, dislocating my shoulder (for the second time), and tearing my labrum (the rim of cartilage that keeps your shoulder in its socket).

A year later, I had surgery to repair the labrum, but there were complications; I had likely torn my labrum a decade earlier when I first dislocated my shoulder, and the labrum was in rough condition.

It's been a long, slow year of physical therapy and excruciatingly incremental progress. But finally, a year after surgery, I was able to get back in the pool, easing my way back to form.

I've joined a modest rural gym with a 25-yard pool. It's the dive bar of gyms, which is perfect for me. I love dive bars.
