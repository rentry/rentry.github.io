When I graduated high school in the diminutive Wyoming town in which I grew up, my parents gave me a Leatherman multitool. That was back in 1999, and so that tool was the original Leatherman tool, the [PST](https://www.leatherman.com/retired-products.html).

While it isn't all that difficult to find a used PST to buy, and Leatherman now sells a ["Heritage" version](https://www.leatherman.com/heritage-pst-832518.html) of the tool, the nostalgia alone makes this particular tool a rare and precious item in my kit. I think a lot of people have similar feelings about Leatherman tools, given how the recent production line of the first Leatherman design ("Mr. Crunch") [sold out in all of 10 minutes](https://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-gear/tools/leatherman-mr-crunch-multitool/). It seems difficult to explain that kind of demand based on utility alone.

I've owned several Leatherman tools over the years, and a former neighbor worked for Leatherman. Through that latter connection, I was able to get the broken file on my original tool repaired, although I suspect that service is available to anyone.

I currently carry the [Wingman](https://www.leatherman.com/wingman-11.html) on search and rescue missions, and have a version of [the Juice](https://www.leatherman.com/en_AT/juice-s2-363.html) in my truck.

But my original PST is my favorite tool I own, based on history alone. I've now lived in Oregon near Leatherman's headquarters for longer than I lived in the Rockies, but my most memorable experiences with my PST are from my time in Wyoming and Montana. Like the time my Golden Retriever, Sam, then just a puppy, found the tool's leather sheath and...customized it. He was just a year old then; he died in 2019 at the age of 15.

It's a classic tool, and I'm grateful it's still serving me after all these years.
