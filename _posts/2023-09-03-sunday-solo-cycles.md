When I was in my twenties and thirties, I used to go on long bike rides nearly every weekend, covering 30â€“50 miles and negotiating a network of country roads, often with no shoulders. 

I never had a serious accident on those rides, although I did experience a few aggressive, honking, [coal-rolling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rolling_coal) assholes, and I took a couple side mirrors to my left shoulder (both on the same stretch of road).

In recent years, the combination of age, injuries, increased vehicle size, and higher general societal aggression have led me to seek rides on dedicated bike paths, gravel roads, and trails.

Now that temperatures are cooling off again, I'm trying to get out for casual rides on Sundays, usually between 20 and 30 miles, with a burrito stop in the middle.

To be honest, I don't even track my mileage...I only know the general distance from having ridden these paths and trails in the past. It's part of the appeal of my Sunday solo rides to relax and enjoy being on the bike again. It's more about exploring new neighborhoods and feeling the flotation of riding the bike than anything else.

Autumn Sundays and old steel bikes are a good combination. There's nothing better than Fall in the Northwest.
