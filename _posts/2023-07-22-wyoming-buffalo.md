I bookended my trip in Buffalo, Wyoming, a small town I recall visiting only twice in my youth (once to visit friends; once to compete in a triathlon), but it's where my parents landed earlier this year.

## Crazy Woman Canyon

We took a drive up Crazy Woman Canyon, the nominal origin of which is partially addressed in [the 1972 film _Jeremiah Johnson_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremiah_Johnson_(film)).

The route ends up in a loop, passing the road I took two days previously to hike the [Sherd Lake Loop Trail]({{ 'wyoming-the-bighorns' | relative_url }}).

## Buffalo becomes Durant

I planned my trip around [Longmire Days](https://www.longmiredays.com/), a celebration of local author Craig Johnson's book series and the resulting [A&E and Netflix TV series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longmire_(TV_series)), during which Buffalo temporarily transforms into the fictional town of Durant.

The town was _hopping_ for Longmire Days, and charming in every way. Summer often transforms Wyoming towns, and Buffalo in the summer reminded me of how Cody, Wyoming (the east gate of Yellowstone), becomes a different place in summer compared to winter.

I watched _Longmire_ from its inception, living in Oregon but craving the nostalgia of my home state (a phenomenon replicated, with slight geographic relocation, by _Yellowstone_).[^1]

[^1]: _Longmire_ is set in Wyoming, but filmed in New Mexico, so...

### Longmire Days auction

By virtue of my parents' neighbor and longtime friend, I worked [the auction for Longmire Days](https://www.longmiredays.com/auction.htm), the proceeds from which were [donated to charity](https://www.longmiredays.com/community.htm). I helped track the winning bids, sitting on a stage while the auction commenced. There are some serious Longmire fans out there, at least one of whom dropped over $20,000 in the auction.

By virtue of a waiver from SAG-AFTRA during the strike, _Longmire_ actors were permitted to attend, and the [actor Robert Taylor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(Australian_actor))‚Äîwho played Walt Longmire in the TV series‚Äîwas on hand for the auction, wandering around taking selfies with fans and promoting the auction. He came and talked with us several times, wearing a T-shirt from Buffalo's [Bond's Brewing](https://bondsbrewing.com/).  Observing him from the auction stage, he seemed as comfortable and at home in that setting as his character would be, albeit _much_ more casual üçª.
