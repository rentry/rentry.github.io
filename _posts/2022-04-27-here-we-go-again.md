Five years ago this month, I explained why I was leaving Facebook (see [_Libertarians are all up in your social media_]({{ '/leaving-facebook/' | relative_url }})).

This time, I don't know how to explain leaving Twitter, other than libertarians are _still_ all up in your social media.

I'm done. Both with Twitter, and with trying to explain. I suppose there was a reason my Twitter bio read "I'm allergic to social media." There are pathogens.
