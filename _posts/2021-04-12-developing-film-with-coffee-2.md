In [part one]({{'developing-film-with-coffee' | relative_url}}), I described the caffenol recipe and general process I used in my first attempt at developing film with coffee.

In this second part, I'll go into more detail about the steps, timing, and agitation.[^1]

## The details
When I decided to try caffenol, I couldn't remember the specific timing and steps for conventional film development, and that turned out to be a problem. Most caffenol blog posts I found shared a recipe—the relative proportions of instant coffee, washing soda, and Vitamin C—but when it came to the details, many read "...and develop as you normally would."

Cobbling together several posts, along with reviewing the conventional process, I settled on the following steps.

### Developer (caffenol)
Review [part one]({{'developing-film-with-coffee' | relative_url}}) for the caffenol recipe I used.

**Time: 11 minutes** for Kodak T-Max 400 (10 minutes for Ilford HP5 400)
1. Pour the caffenol into the loaded Paterson tank.
1. Agitate continually for the first full minute.
1. Agitate 3–4 times at the beginning of each minute after (equivalent to 10 seconds at the beginning of each minute).

[^1]: Agitation is the process of slowly turning the tank upside down and then right side up again

### Stop
**Time: 1 minute**

Conventional film development uses a chemical to stop the development process (referred to as "stop bath"). I used water instead.

1. Drain the caffenol from the tank.
1. Rinse with running water for 1 minute (or fill the tank and drain repeatedly for 1 minute).

### Fixer
**Time: 3–7 minutes**[^2]

This is the only part of the caffenol process that uses a conventional chemical. But fixer, unlike developer, can be reused (I've read it can be reused up to 10 times, but I intend to test that claim).

I used [Ilford Rapid Fixer](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/rapid-fixer-product), which calls for 1 part fixer to 4 parts water. I used 100ml of fixer and 400ml of water.

1. Pour the diluted fixer into the tank.
1. Agitate 3–4 times at the beginning of each minute for 3–7 minutes.

[^2]: Fixer times range wildly in caffenol posts. [Ilford](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/) claims, in the context of conventional development, that fixer times are not critical, so long as you [use fixer for at least 3 minutes](https://www.ilfordphoto.com/beginners-guide-processing-film/).

### Wash
**Time: ~2 minutes**

1. Drain the fixer into a reusable bottle (you can reuse fixer).
1. Fill the tank with water and agitate 5 times.
1. Drain and fill the tank again, agitate 10 times.
1. Drain and fill the tank again, agitate 20 times.
1. Add a few drops of wetting agent (or dish soap), agitate and drain.[^3]

[^3]: I used dish soap for my first caffenol attempt, and it didn't work out so well. If you use wetting agent, which I'm going to use next time, follow manufacturer directions.

Remove the reels from the tank, remove the film from the reel, and hang it using clothespins or clips to dry.
