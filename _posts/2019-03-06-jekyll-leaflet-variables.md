This is crazy. There are so many mustaches ({ }) in Liquid _and_ JavaScript.

But it turns out, a bunch of smart people figured out which mustaches (_fine_, curly brackets or braces or whatever) belong to which bits of code. Consequently, you can _use Liquid variables in your JavaScript_.

Iâ€™ve alluded to this before, as smarter people than I (namely [Katy DeCorah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s84wFRD8vfE)) have already demonstrated the flexibility of Jekyll + JS.

## DRY mapping

~~My last post demonstrated the need for a map to show walking trails.~~ (_Iâ€™ve since removed my posts related to walking locations after belatedly reviewing updated [Leave No Trace Guidance](https://lnt.org/new-social-media-guidance/)_.)

I prefer [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) for this sort of thing, but I didnâ€™t want to replicate the full script for each map instance. In other words, I wanted to remain faithful to the sacred **D**onâ€™t **R**epeat **Y**ourself principle, and only add new code for new attributes.

So I abstracted the common code into a [Jekyll include](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/includes/), and I created front matter variables that allow me to control the latitude, longitude, zoom level, and pop-up text for each map instance.

Hereâ€™s what it looks like:

### Include (`map.html`)
{% raw %}
```html
<div class="map" id="{{ page.map-id }}"></div>

<script>
    var {{ page.map-var }}= L.map('{{ page.map-id }}').setView([{{ page.lat }}, {{ page.long }}], {{ page.zoom }});
    var marker = L.marker([{{ page.lat }}, {{ page.long }}]).addTo({{ page.map-var }});

    L.tileLayer('https://tiles.wmflabs.org/bw-mapnik/{z}/{x}/{y}.png', {
	maxZoom: 18,
	attribution: '&copy; <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright">OpenStreetMap</a> contributors'
    }).addTo({{ page.map-var }});

    marker.bindPopup("<strong>{{ page.popup-title }}</strong><br>{{ page.popup-text }}");

</script>
```
{% endraw %}

### Front matter
```yaml

But I no longer subscribe to most social media, so Iâ€™ll share my walks here, starting with a walk to Annieâ€™s Cabin near Molalla, Oregon."

```

Finally, with the script and front matter in place, we simply drop the include where we want it to appear, in this form:

{% raw %}
```
{% include map.html %}
```
{% endraw %}

Thatâ€™s it! Well, not really. You need to include the Leaflet scripts and styles and so on...just [consult the quick-start guide](https://leafletjs.com/examples/quick-start/) for that. 

Once you have Leaflet configured, just change your front matter variables based on each map instance. Youâ€™ll need to get creative if you have multiple maps per page, but you know what to do. ðŸ’ª

If you donâ€™t know what to do, itâ€™s fine. Weâ€™ll get to it at some point. Take a walk in the woods in the meantime.

{% include map.html %}
