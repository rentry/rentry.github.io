        description: "A gift from a friend who works at Patagonia, this hardcover book came autographed by Yvon Chouinard. I've rarely been more excited about a gift. My enthusiasm about the signature was quickly accompanied by adoration of the stories. In an early story, he writes, “All winter I forged gear. For the rest of the year, I continued to lead a counter-culture life on the fringes of society—living on fifty cents a day on a diet of oatmeal, potatoes, and canned cat food; camping all summer in an old incinerator in the abandoned CCC (Civilian Conservation Corps) camp in the Tetons of Wyoming.”"

Marshall was a forester, writer, socialist, and founder of The Wilderness Society, all before dying of heart failure at the age of just 38. He was, truly, an original."

        description: "<cite>Homage to Catalonia</cite> is Orwell's personal account of his experience fighting against fascists during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. It's difficult to imagine a contemporary author of Orwell's stature joining the front lines of such a war, but perhaps that's why Orwell is so unique among western authors. Following the war, Orwell wrote, “Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for Democratic Socialism, as I understand it.”"

        description: "This book begins with a question: “Is it possible to explain words with words?” It's an excellent question. Is it possible to explain with words why one would read a book attempting to explain words with words? Probably not. Even so, I found myself referencing line after line from this book, organizing quotes in my notes app. Even when focused on events from the 1930s (the decade in which this book was written), the ideas and framing feel more relevant than ever. The book's author, Stuart Chase, combined a few words that were later adopted for a transformative socioeconomic policy: “A New Deal.” Of course, the phrase is making a comeback, accompanied by a new hue."

With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power...They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest.” - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the U.S."
