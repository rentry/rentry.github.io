        description: "“In Theological Territories, David Bentley Hart, one of America's most eminent contemporary writers on religion, reflects on the state of theology ‘at the borders’ of other fields of discourse—metaphysics, philosophy of mind, science, the arts, ethics, and biblical hermeneutics in particular. The book advances many of Hart's larger theological projects, developing and deepening numerous dimensions of his previous work. Theological Territories constitutes something of a manifesto regarding the manner in which theology should engage other fields of concern and scholarship.”"

        description: "“Robin Wall Kimmerer is writer of rare grace. She writes about the natural world from a place of such abundant passion that one can never quite see the world the same way after having seen it through Kimmerer’s eyes. In <cite>Braiding Sweetgrass</cite>, she takes us on a journey that is every bit as mythic as it is scientific, as sacred as it is historical, as clever as it is wise. She is a great teacher, and her words are a hymn of love to the world.”–Elizabeth Gilbert"

        description: "“In Lessons from Walden, Taylor lets all sides have their say, even as he persistently steers the discussion back to a nuanced reading of Thoreau's actual position. With its tone of friendly urgency, this interdisciplinary tour de force will interest students and scholars of American literature, environmental ethics, and political theory. It deserves to be read by a more general readership, including environmental activists, concerned citizens, and anyone troubled with the future of democracy.”–Notre Dame Press"

On the other hand, I don't blame them for being angry. Things keep getting worse for almost everyone, almost everyday. Their analysis on the first page of this book is precise: “If you're reading these words, you're likely living in despair and hopelessness.” There are moments of earnestness, truth, authenticity, and desperation throughout this book. It's worth a read."

        description: Originally published in 1993 and 1998 respectively, this book and its sequel, <cite>Parable of the Talents</cite>, have <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/second-read/octavia-butlers-prescient-vision-of-a-zealot-elected-to-make-america-great-again">proven to be disturbingly prescient</a>. Climate change, crippling inequality, mass privatization, and widespread arson form the backdrop of the series, while a right-wing fanatic promises to “make America great again.” Prescient, indeed.

        description: "<cite>Homage to Catalonia</cite> is Orwell's personal account of his experience fighting against fascists during the Spanish Civil War in the 1930s. It's difficult to imagine a contemporary author of Orwell's stature joining the front lines of such a war, but perhaps that's why Orwell is so unique among western authors. Following the war, Orwell wrote, “Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for Democratic Socialism, as I understand it.”"

Is it possible to explain with words why one would read a book attempting to explain words with words? Probably not. Even so, I found myself referencing line after line from this book, organizing quotes in my notes app. Even when focused on events from the 1930s (the decade in which this book was written), the ideas and framing feel more relevant than ever. The book's author, Stuart Chase, combined a few words that were later adopted for a transformative socioeconomic policy: “A New Deal.” Of course, the phrase is making a comeback, accompanied by a new hue."

        description: "Benjamin Dreyer, copy chief at Random House, delivers a surprisingly humorous book on grammar and style. I couldn't put this book down, partly because I'm a grammar nerd and share many of the author's “peeves and crotchets,” but mostly because nearly every line of this book is exceptionally intelligent and funny."

        description: I’m re-learning Python in the context of data science and machine learning. Which is kind of weird and gross, to be honest. That said, the book is well-structured, well-written, and informative, and it surveys a discipline conspicuously on the rise.

        description: "I’m enamored with this intricate atlas of ungulate (hoofed mammals) migration in Wyoming. Not only is it a project that involved my two alma maters (University of Oregon for data visualization, Oregon State University Press printed the book), but it also features my home state and research from its university (University of Wyoming). The book’s photographs and data visualizations are beautiful. This book has all my favorites: photography, data visualization, GIS, and wildlife."
