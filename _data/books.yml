Is it possible to explain with words why one would read a book attempting to explain words with words? I'm about to find out. (The book's author, Stuart Chase, combined a few words that were later adopted for a transformative socioeconomic policy: “A New Deal.” Of course, the phrase is making a comeback, accompanied by a new hue.)"
