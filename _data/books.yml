  description: "I've been a Wilco fan for many years. I saw Wilco live in Eugene, Oregon, in 2003, and Jeff Tweedy solo in 2006 (with a demonstrably shitty audience in Portland, captured on the Sunken Treasure DVD). I own <em>I Am Trying to Break Your Heart: A Film About Wilco</em>. So obviously the algorithm would serve up this book."

  description: "The translator said in a podcast (regarding Christianity in the U.S.), and I'm certain he's correct, “America is a great gnostic adventure at the end of the day. I'm not sure Christianity will ever reach these shores, but if it does, it's going to find a very intractable people here...very hard to convert.”"

  description: "“The American fascist would prefer not to use violence. His method is to poison the channels of public information. With a fascist the problem is never how best to present the truth to the public but how best to use the news to deceive the public into giving the fascist and his group more money or more power...They claim to be super-patriots, but they would destroy every liberty guaranteed by the Constitution. They demand free enterprise, but are the spokesmen for monopoly and vested interest.” - Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the U.S. <em>This is the most relevant book I've read in a while.</em>"

  description: I’m re-learning Python in the context of data science and machine learning. Which is kind of weird and gross, to be honest. That said, the book is well-structured, well-written, and informative, and it surveys a discipline conspicuously on the rise.

  description: I’m enamored with this intricate atlas of ungulate (hoofed mammals) migration in Wyoming. Not only is it a project that involved my two alma maters (University of Oregon for data visualization, Oregon State University press printed the book), but it also features my home state and research from its university (University of Wyoming). The book’s photographs and data visualizations are beautiful. I’m passionate about photography, data visualization, GIS, and wildlife.
