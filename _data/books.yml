  description: This intricate atlas of ungulate (hoofed mammals) migration in Wyoming is one of my favorite books in a while. Not only is it a project that involved my two alma maters (University of Oregon for data visualization, Oregon State University press printed the book), but it also features my home state and research from its university (University of Wyoming). The book's photographs and data visualizations are beautiful. I'm passionate about photography, data visualization, GIS, and wildlife.
