  description: "My favorite episode of one of my favorite podcasts, <em>The Ezra Klein Show</em>, featured a lengthy discussion with author Kate Manne. Hearing Professor Manne describe structural misogyny feels at once revelatory and obvious, a contradiction characteristic of our time. “You will understand our current moment far better and more easily after having read <em>Down Girl</em>,” writes Rebecca Traister."

It is a gem, from a legendary writer. “What is above all needed is to let the meaning choose the word, and not the other way about.” Its compendium — <em>Review of</em> Mein Kampf — is staggering and terrifying, because it's relevant."

  description: "I'd been hearing about and seeing this book around so much lately, I figured it was time to finally crack it open. “...Daniel Kahneman, the renowned psychologist and winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, takes us on a groundbreaking tour of the mind and explains the two systems that drive the way we think. System 1 is fast, intuitive, and emotional; System 2 is slower, more deliberative, and more logical.” This book is a revelatory mindfuck that I highly recommend."

Despite the catastrophic future we've created for ourselves, perhaps we can muster the will to prevent the worst of the devastating impacts coming our way?"
