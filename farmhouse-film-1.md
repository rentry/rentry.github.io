# Farmhouse film series

We're starting a summer film series. We'll watch films, projected outside, around the campfire.

## Part 1: Pan's Labyrinth



## When

- <strike>Saturday, October 13<br>
4 p.m. to whenever</strike>

Event is over

## Where
Event is complete

## What to bring
We'll grill some meats and provide some side dishes, but feel free to bring snacks or beverages (especially if you don't want to eat meat).

## Pet stuff
As you know, dogs will be here. Some of them are super cute and _super_ emotional (we all know I'm talking about Henry).

Our dogs are good boys (especially Sam), but if you want to bring kids and/or dogs with you, let us know so we can plan accordingly.

## What if it rains?!?
Rain sounds really, really good right now, but I'm sure we'll be sick of it again soon. If it rains: we have a large, covered shop. We have a canopy to seek refuge under. Oh, and there's a house. So we're good.

## The elephant in the room
There is a [football game](https://goducks.com/schedule.aspx?schedule=2357) ‚Äì <span class="ducks">Ducks</span> vs. <span class="enemy">The Enemy</span> ‚Äì scheduled for Oct. 13. The exact time for this epic and sacred battle is yet to be determined. This unfortunate accident of history might affect the attention and focus of one of the hosts (and possibly some guests). But alas, we will adapt, and we shall not worry.

**Update:** The game is set for 12:30 p.m., so come by early, if you want to observe anxious Ryan!
