      <p class="style3">yesterday was completely bizarre. it began around noon or so when my father snatched an injured blue bird (charlie) from the grass. the poor guy had a broken wing. we nursed him through the night and let him go today, but he didn't fly off. i am still worried about him.</p>
      <p class="style3">most bizarre, perhaps, was an attack on a poor standard poodle named fred. he was chasing a beaver around a pond when the beaver turned in defense and cut a giant hole of flesh from fred's chest in one bite. after bleeding profusely on the porch for awhile, my father gathered him up and paid a visit to the emergency vet in red lodge. fred will, in all estimation, be just fine. while helen nees attended to her dog's wounds, her husband paul fired well-aimed bullets into the guilty beaver's body. </p>
      <p class="style3">my mother, erinn, and myself then went to...a barndance. a fox and a moose crossed the road in the gloaming as we were driving, and the night sky was glorious. i haven't much to say about the 300 person, live band, free food and booze hoe-down, other than i've never seen anything like it. just another day in montana. </p>
