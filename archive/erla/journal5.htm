      <p class="style3">today i led a group of photographers working for jeep into rimrock lake. rimrock is 6 miles toward cooke city, and beyond the point where the fire came down off of shepherd in 1996. the photographers (phil, josh, and tom) were given a sample shot of some rapids with mountains in the background from their client, beth. they were to attempt to replicate this shot as best they could, (even though there are superior views to be had up here.)</p>
      <p class="style3">phil packed in his convertible digital/film 22 megapixel hasselblad along with a 35mm canon to get the shot. the day was basically cooperative, other than a few snow flurries close to rimrock. most of the time was spent waiting for sunshine so composite shots would work out. the final image was well worth their time. </p>
