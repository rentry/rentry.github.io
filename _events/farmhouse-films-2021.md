# Farmhouse films 2021 preview

Two films are planned for Spring 2021...

## First Cow

> That patient, inscrutable animal is the title character, and in effect the female lead, of First Cow, Kelly Reichardt’s deceptively simple and wondrously subtle new film. A parable of economics and politics, with shrewd insights into the workings of supply and demand, scarcity and scale and other puzzles of the marketplace, the movie is also keenly attuned to details of history, both human and natural… And like many great westerns it critiques some of the genre’s foundational myths with bracing, beautiful rigor, including the myth of heroic individualism.

– A.O. Scott, <cite>The New York Times</cite>

## Frida

> Frida is a movie about art that is a work of art in itself. The film's unique visual language takes us into an artist's head and reminds us that art is best enjoyed when it moves, breathes and is painted on a giant canvas, as only the movies can provide.

– The American Film Institute
