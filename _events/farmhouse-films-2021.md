# Farmhouse films 2021 preview

Two films are planned for Spring 2021...

## First Cow

> The word “epic” when applied to movies usually suggests sweep and grandeur, world-shaking events and a cast of thousands. But for Ezra Pound, an epic was “a poem containing history,” and by that standard Kelly Reichardt’s quietly ambitious, mischievously profound film surely qualifies. It’s a quiet, lyrical story of friendship and enterprise, set in the Oregon Territory before the Civil War, with John Magaro and Orion Lee as tender comrades and unlikely business partners. But the history is there if you pay attention — the grand, terrible story of global capitalism and territorial conquest. The cow is pretty awesome, too.

– A.O. Scott, <cite>The New York Times</cite>

## Frida

> Frida is a movie about art that is a work of art in itself. The film's unique visual language takes us into an artist's head and reminds us that art is best enjoyed when it moves, breathes and is painted on a giant canvas, as only the movies can provide.

– The American Film Institute
