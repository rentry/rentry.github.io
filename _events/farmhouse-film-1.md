# Farmhouse film event

Cousin Brian and Emily, you are cordially invited to this special film event. My nephew, Owen, will also join us. We'll watch one of my favorite films of all time, projected outside, around the campfire (if my projector still works, and fire restrictions allow).

## Pan's Labyrinth

> Pan's Labyrinth (Spanish: El laberinto del fauno, lit. 'The Labyrinth of the Faun') is a 2006 Spanish dark fantasy drama film written and directed by Guillermo del Toro, and starring Ivana Baquero, Sergi L√≥pez, Maribel Verd√∫, Doug Jones, and Ariadna Gil. The story takes place in Spain during the summer of 1944, five years after the Spanish Civil War, during the early Francoist period. The narrative intertwines this real world with a mythical world centered on an overgrown, abandoned labyrinth and a mysterious faun creature, with whom the main character, Ofelia, interacts. Ofelia's stepfather, the Falangist Captain Vidal, hunts the Spanish Maquis who fight against the Francoist regime in the region, while Ofelia's pregnant mother Carmen grows increasingly ill. Ofelia meets several strange and magical creatures who become central to her story, leading her through the trials of the old labyrinth garden. The film employs make-up, animatronics, and CGI effects to bring life to its creatures. - [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pan's_Labyrinth)

> El laberinto del fauno is explicitly about fascism, but is of interest not simply because of its subject matter but above all because of del Toro‚Äôs iconoclastic approach to the rendering of fascism on screen. In obvious ways, the film came through Hollywood by way of a distinctively non-U.S. sensibility, a Mexican sensibility in which the question of fascist dictatorship is perceived by the filmmaker both personally and historically. In del Toro‚Äôs case, following his father‚Äôs kidnapping in 1998 he was forced into exile, a condition in which he remains today. But what makes del Toro‚Äôs artistic approach to fascism so different from that of the run-of-the-mill Hollywood production, such as Steven Spielberg‚Äôs Schindler‚Äôs List, is his construction of a transcendent fascist-monster archetype. Schindler‚Äôs List, in contrast, offers fascist social types that cannot exist anywhere but in Nazi Germany. Moreover, unlike Schindler‚Äôs List, where there are antifascist German capitalists and fascist German capitalists (a clever ideological invention on Spielberg‚Äôs part, since in reality there were no German capitalists who opposed fascism), in El laberinto del fauno, all the capitalists are behind fascism, which is shown, as we shall see, in one of the film‚Äôs most compelling scenes. - [sdonline](http://sdonline.org/47/the-antifascist-aesthetics-of-pan%E2%80%99s-labyrinth/)
