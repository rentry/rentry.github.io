## About the film

> First Cow, the latest Western by Kelly Reichardt, is up for three [Independent Spirit] awards: Best Feature, Best Director and Best Supporting Male for Orion Lee.

> Lee plays King Lu, a Chinese immigrant who teams up with Cookie (John Magaro), a meek cook for a party of fur trappers, to launch a successful fried cake business in the Oregon Territory. The only problem is their recipe requires milk, which they end up pilfering in the middle of a night from a landowner's prized cow.

> The script is loosely adapted from Portland author Jonathan Raymond's 2004 novel, The Half-Life, and adds the adorable titular farm animal to the parable on early American capitalism.

> Reichardt has long trained her lens on Oregon, exploring the far stretches of the eastern part of the state in Meek's Cutoff (2010) to the gritty streets of North Portland in Wendy and Lucy (2008).


## What to bring
Bring food, drinks, face masks, and whatever optimism about the future you have left.

We won't provide any snacks this time, so please bring everything you need to be comfortable and warm.
