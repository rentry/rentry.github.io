<h1>Farmhouse film event: <br><cite>It's a Wonderful Life</cite></h1>

## When

Wednesday, December 23, 2020<br>
4:30 p.m.

We'll only show the movie if weather cooperates. This will be a chilly outdoor event. We'll have the campfire, but no popcorn or beverages. Bring your own holiday snacks! And bring layers and blankets!

Also, this is my sister's birthday! (Sadly, she won't be here.)

## Where
Ryan and Erinn's farmhouse
<br><em>email or text Ryan if you need directions.</em>


## About the film

I adore this classic, and I watch it every year. I can't wait to watch it outside around the campfire!

## What to bring
Bring food, drinks, facemasks, and whatever optimism about the future you have left.

We won't provide any snacks this time, so please bring everything you need to be comfortable and warm.
