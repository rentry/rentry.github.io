## About the film

From Wikipedia: 

> The film has attracted retrospective reviews. Emily VanDerWerff of Vox said, “[The film] may be [Shyamalan's] best film, and one of the most interesting looks at the American film industry's early attempts to incorporate the Iraq War into fictional contexts. It's been unjustly derided, and now is as good a time as any to change that.” She went on to praise the twist ending, the possible connections between the plot and the Iraq War, and the technical aspects, including the cinematography. Adam Chitwood of Collider praised the ending, the performances of Howard, Phoenix, and Hurt, and the cinematography. He also went on to say, “[The film] shines when it digs into themes of humanity's relationship with sorrow, and whether pain and violence can be excised from our lives or if we're destined to fall prey to harmful sins. Devoid of expectations, [the film] holds up far better than you may remember.”

## What to bring
Bring food, drinks, facemasks, and whatever optimism about the future you have left.
