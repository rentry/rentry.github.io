<h1>Farmhouse film event and üòì house cooling üòÖ: <cite>Pleasantville</cite></h1>

_Update (9/13):_

We'll still show this movie (weather permitting...honestly, if it's ruined by rain, that sounds okay, too), in celebration of my cousin's birthday, and gratitude that our house is still standing.

New date (maybe):

Sunday, September 27, 2020 <br>5:30 p.m.

_Update (9/12):_

‚ö†Ô∏è We're evacuated because of wildfires in Oregon. We obviously cannot show this wonderful film at this time, as we wait for word on if and when we can go home.

_Update (9/4):_

<img src="/assets/images/no_fire.svg" alt="Flames crossed out indicating no fire" width="30px" height="30px" /> <em>Sadly, we won't be able to have a campfire during this film event. The fire district rating is currently `Extreme`. We live in an Oregon Department of Forestry "protection zone," which bans recreational fires under those conditions.</em>

## About the film

> Director Gary Ross stated, "This movie is about the fact that personal repression gives rise to larger political oppression...That when we're afraid of certain things in ourselves or we're afraid of change, we project those fears on to other things, and a lot of very ugly social situations can develop."

> I knew you'd pay a price for this. I knew you couldn't be so hopelessly geek-ridden for so long without suffering some really tragic consequences.
