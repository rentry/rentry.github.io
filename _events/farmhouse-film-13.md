## About the film

> Javier Bardem, looking worldly and much older than his 33 years, plays Agustin Rejas, a police officer in an unnamed South American state on the trail of a revolutionary-anarchist mastermind called Ezequiel, loosely based on Peru's Chairman Gonzalo of Shining Path. This uniquely dangerous man is on the very cusp of unseating the tinpot dictators, having apparently captured the imagination of his countrymen, from the highest to the lowest, with terrorist acts and bizarre situationist stunts. Meanwhile Agustin is falling languidly and unhappily in love with his daughter's ballet teacher Yolanda, a beautiful and miraculously unattached woman played by Laura Morante.

## What to bring
Bring food, drinks, and whatever optimism about the future you have left.

## We're excited to see you

> "Sometime in your life you will have the occasion to say, what is this thing called time? You know, what is that - the clock. You go to work by the clock, you get your martini in the afternoon by the clock, you have your coffee by the clock, get on a plane at certain time and arrive, and it goes on and on and on... And time is a dictator, as we know it. Where does it go? What does it do? Most of all, is it alive? It is a thing you cannot touch, and is alive. And then one day you look in the mirror - how old. You say, where did time go?"
