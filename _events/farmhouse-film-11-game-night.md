<h1>Farmhouse <strike>film</strike> game event: <br><cite>Super Mario World</cite></h1>

## When

Saturday, July 3, 2021<br>
5:30 p.m.

We'll only ~~show the movie~~ play this game if weather cooperates. We'll have the campfire, snacks, and beverages (thanks vaccine!).

## Where
Ryan and Erinn's farmhouse
<br><em>email or text Ryan if you need directions.</em>

## Wait, what?

I have a [Super Nintendo Classic](https://www.nintendo.com/super-nes-classic/) ("NOW YOUâ€™RE PLAYING WITH SUPER POWER,"...says the website ðŸ™„). We'll plug it into the projector via HDMI outside and...figure it out.  If it doesn't work, we'll have the campfire to warm us and heal our emotional wounds.

## About the ~~film~~ game

> Super Mario World is a 2D Mario platform game and a launch title released for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System in 1990, developed by Nintendo EAD. Being a sequel to Super Mario Bros. 3, the game retains many of the elements that debuted in Super Mario Bros. 3, such as the world map and Koopaling boss fights, while introducing a large variety of new gameplay mechanics, such as an expanded and less linear world map and the ability to save the game. Introduced in Super Mario World is Mario's sidekick, Yoshi (and his species that shares his name), where he serves as a playable mount for the Mario Bros. with his own unique abilities and gameplay style.

## What to bring
We'll have some snacks, but feel free to bring your own snacks, beverages, and whatever optimism about the future you have left.
