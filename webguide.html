<h3 id="our-audience">Our audience</h3>
<p>Every decision we make regarding the website should be done with our audience in mind.</p>
<h4 id="who-is-our-primary-audience">Who is our primary audience?</h4>
<p>The residents and businesses of Clackamas County—our customers—are the primary audience for the county website. All web activity should be conducted to optimize their web experience.</p>
<p>When considering content management and other web-related decisions, we should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How does this content serve our customers?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the format and placement of this content appropriate to the need and volume of our customers?</p></li>
<li><p>Is the website the best avenue to deliver this message or service?</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="who-are-our-secondary-audiences">Who are our secondary audiences?</h4>
<p>Our secondary audiences include county partners, both public and private, county employees, prospective employees, the larger business community, the media, and others who visit our website.</p>
<p>In most cases, information and content specific to county staff will be housed on the <a href="http://web1.clackamas.us">county intranet</a>, not on the county website.</p>
<h4 id="what-about-special-service-districts">What about special service districts?</h4>
<p>Special service districts often rely on their brand to communicate effectively with customers about their services. The county website will accommodate those brand needs to the extent possible within the context of a consistent county brand presence.</p>
<h3 id="writing-for-the-web">Writing for the web</h3>
<p>Our objective is to provide the highest level of service to our customers. One way we can achieve this objective is to employ best practices when writing for the web.</p>
<h4 id="what-does-our-audience-want-most-from-our-website">What does our audience want most from our website?</h4>
<p>Visitors to the county website usually don't want to read through a large amount of text to find information. When you write for the web, start with the question: what does my audience want to know?</p>
    <p>Meet that need by being:</p>
<ul>
    <li>concise</li>
    <li>specific</li>
    <li>informative</li>
    <li>clear and to the point</li>

    </ul>
<p>Edit your content to surface the information of key importance to your web users. We respect our website visitors by providing the information they need as quickly and efficiently as possible.</p>
<h4 id="where-to-publish">Where to publish</h4>
<p>We have a website, so we should publish everything there, right? Not necessarily. Think about the most effective and efficient way to deliver your message. We have alternative platforms to get your message out, such as social media and email, which could be more effective, depending on the content.</p>
<h4 id="dont-push-content-at-users-let-them-pull-it">Don't 'push' content at users; let them 'pull' it</h4>
<p>Publishing everything we produce can overwhelm both our search function and our users. In some cases, it may be best to allow users to request certain documents or other information via the website rather than automatically publish them, particularly if the information is only relevant to a small group. <strong>Think of the website in terms of a phone rather than a file cabinet.</strong> Try to anticipate the tasks your web visitor is trying to achieve and meet that need efficiently through your content and presentation.</p>
<h4 id="front-load">Front-load</h4>
<p>Put the most important information first.</p>
<p>Web user eye-tracking studies show that people tend to 'read' a webpage in an 'F' shape pattern, looking across the top, then down the side, reading further across when they find what they need.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img class="fill" src="assets/images/eyetracking.jpg" alt="Eye-tracking study" />
<p class="caption">Eye-tracking study</p>
</div>
<p>For this reason, put sub-headings, titles, and bullet points up front. Get to your point concisely and immediately.</p>
<h4 id="break-up-content-into-chunks">Break up content into chunks</h4>
<p>Use sub-headings, bullets, and short paragraphs to convey your message. This will allow users to review your content quickly and locate the information relevant to them.</p>
<p>Be consistent with tense and verb form when using bullets, with any common information in the preceding sentence.</p>

<h4 id="avoid-click-here-links">Avoid 'click here' links</h4>

    </div>

<h4 id="avoid-lengthy-welcome-messages">Avoid lengthy 'Welcome' messages</h4>
<p>Welcome messages and mission statements distract from the task-centered and service-related content on our webpages.</p>
<p>Mission statements are important for internal staff and the cohesion of an organization working toward a common goal, but the overwhelming majority of web visitors are not coming to our webpages to read mission statements. They are coming to complete a task.</p>
<p>Welcome messages and mission statements push down the content our web visitors are coming to our webpages to locate, particularly if they are using mobile devices to access our web content. Even a relatively brief welcome message can push the most important content far down the screen on a phone.</p>
<p>When you write content for the web, consider which task or tasks your user is coming to your website to accomplish and provide the opportunity to complete that task as early in the process as possible.</p>
<h4 id="web-writing-resources">Web writing resources</h4>
<p>One of the most effective tools for improving your web writing is a free, online application called <a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/">Hemingway Editor</a>. This easy-to-use tool will rate your content for readability and give you hints on how to improve your web writing by using an active voice, avoiding adverbs and simplifying your language.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.hemingwayapp.com/"><img class="fill" src="assets/images/hemingway.jpg" alt="Hemingway app" /></a></p>
<h4 id="voice-and-tone">Voice and tone</h4>
<p>We have a tendency to use a detached, impersonal and &quot;governmental&quot; tone here at the county. While we are obviously government, the tone of our web writing should be inviting, warm, and personal for our web users.</p>
<p>Even if the services we are describing are regulatory or compliance-based, we can still convey them in a personal, friendly, and service-oriented way. For example, instead of 'the department,' use 'we' or 'us.' Rather than a passive voice, such as &quot;You will be notified in 3 days,&quot; write: &quot;We will notify you in 3 days.&quot;</p>
<h4 id="our-style-guide">Our style guide</h4>
<p>For guidance on which format to use for phone numbers, addresses, time, dates, etc., see our <a href="styleguide.html">web writing style guide</a>. <!--Not live yet--></p>
<h4 id="our-typeface">Our typeface</h4>
<p>The web font we use is <a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway">Raleway</a>. This font should be used for all text on the county website.</p>
<h3 id="website-management">Website management</h3>
<p>This section defines the roles and responsibilities of the individuals involved with designing, managing, and updating county websites. The recommended structure separates content from design and presentation.</p>
<p>County websites are created and managed by Technology Services and Public &amp; Government Affairs, in consultation with county department representatives. Technology Services is responsible for tech support, site and server maintenance, application development and information architecture.</p>
<p>Public &amp; Government Affairs is responsible for content review and management, department content support, policy compliance, content design, and the overall effectiveness of web and digital communications.</p>
<p>The Web Governance Committee, comprised of senior staff from County Administration, Public &amp; Government Affairs, and Technology Services, advises on the management, policy direction, and ultimate disposition of the website and web-related assets.</p>

<h4 id="web-communications-workflow">Web communications workflow</h4>
<p>This is the general web communications workflow. Additional steps may be required depending on content and technical needs. This workflow assumes consistent communication among county staff.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img class="fill" src="assets/images/workflow.jpg" alt="Web content workflow" />
</div>
<h3 id="multimedia-content">Multimedia Content</h3>
<p>The thoughtful use of multimedia (photos, graphics, videos, etc.) is extremely important when communicating with our audience via the website.</p>
<h4 id="images">Images</h4>
<p>Images on the website include photos, illustrations, diagrams, buttons, infographics, and static maps, among others. While images can be compelling communications tools, they have significant drawbacks if misused. Images by themselves aren't ADA-friendly, so they often need supplemental text in order to be accessible to people using assistive technology (such as screenreaders).</p>
<p>Think about why you are using the image. What is it conveying? Most users aren't coming to the county website to be entertained by photos; they are coming to complete a task. Does the image assist them in completing their task?</p>
<p>County departments are free to choose the images for their respective webpages as long as the images:</p>
<ul>
<li>are relevant to page content</li>
<li>are not duplicative or excessive</li>
<li>are not copyrighted</li>
<li>only include individuals who have authorized the use of their image (if applicable)</li>
<li>have been credited to the source (if applicable)</li>
<li>do not advertise a brand or service (some exceptions apply—consult with Public &amp; Government Affairs)</li>
</ul>
<p>Images should be authentic and honest. We want our images to reflect the spirit of transparency the public expects from us. To that end, here are some best practices for using images on the county website.</p>
<h4 id="avoid-stock-images">1. Avoid stock images</h4>
<p>Stock images, while convenient, are inauthentic. Viewers can easily identify a stock image versus an authentic image. Whenever possible, seek out an authentic alternative to a stock photo or eliminate the image if none can be found.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img class="fill" src="assets/images/stockisbad.jpg" alt="Inauthetic stock photo of office workers" />
</div>
<h4 id="turn-off-the-date-stamp">2. Turn off the date stamp</h4>
<p>Sometimes we forget to turn off that pesky date stamp in the bottom corner of the photo.</p>
<h4 id="do-not-use-images-from-the-internet">3. Do not use images from the Internet</h4>
<p>While you may find the perfect photo for your needs through an online search, it's probably copyrighted.</p>
<h4 id="do-not-use-heavily-modified-images">4. Do not use heavily modified images</h4>
<p>Try to keep images stylistically consistent from page to page and avoid using elaborate image effects. Drop shadows, feathered edges, and collages can be distracting and visually overwhelming to website visitors.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img class="fill" src="assets/images/agcollage.jpg" alt="Agriculture collage with feathered edges" />
<p class="caption">Agriculture collage with feathered edges</p>
</div>
<h4 id="use-consistent-icon-and-button-styles">5. Use consistent icon and button styles</h4>
<p>The web team (Technology Services) has created a series of icons and buttons for various purposes, including video, documents, ePayment, etc. If your department requires a custom icon or icon set, please contact Public & Government Affairs.</p>
<h4 id="use-high-quality-images">6. Use high quality images</h4>
<p>Be sure to pay attention to the resolution of photographs (set camera settings to high quality or RAW), cropping, focus, lighting, and the relative size of the image on the page. If you need assistance with editing and preparing images, consult Public &amp; Government Affairs or Technology Services.</p>
<h4 id="do-not-use-animated-images">7. Do not use animated images</h4>
<p>Do not use flashing, blinking, or other animated images (such as animated GIFs) which can be very distracting and unprofessional. Exceptions may apply in some cases, such as animated charts and graphs. Public &amp; Government Affairs and Technology Services must approve the use of animation on the county website.</p>
<h4 id="using-alt-text">Using 'alt' text</h4>
<p>Alt text (or “alt tag”) is a text alternative to an image. Alt text essentially describes an image to users who cannot see the image because of vision impairment or blindness. Alt text is also used by search engines to index images in search results.</p>
<p>It is best to avoid using words such as “image” or “photo” in alt text. Use text that concisely and effectively describes what is actually conveyed in the image itself.</p>
<p>Our policy is to always use alt text for images to ensure our web content is accessible to users.</p>
<h4 id="video">Video</h4>
<p>Video is among the county's most compelling communication tools. Public &amp; Government Affairs can help departments visually capture programs, initiatives, projects and human interest stories to promote county services, share successes, and provide important information.</p>
<p>We encourage departments to use video to communicate programs and services. Video published to the county website:</p>
<ul>
<li>should be limited to five minutes except for county commission meetings and events</li>
<li>from external organizations must first be authorized by Public &amp; Government Affairs</li>
<li>can be uploaded to YouTube and embedded on appropriate county webpage(s)</li>
<li>should be accompanied by an image release for any individuals who appear in the video (except county staff)</li>
</ul>
<div class="figure">
<img src="assets/images/youtube_vid.jpg" alt="YouTube video player" />
<p class="caption">YouTube video player</p>
</div>
<h4 id="metadata">Metadata</h4>
<p>Metadata is information about web media, such as documents, images, and video, that informs search engines about what the content is. Search engines cannot “read” an image; there is no way for a search engine to know what an image conveys unless metadata tells it what the image is.</p>
<p>Metadata is especially important for images and other media files, but it is also vital to enhance the effectiveness of search for PDF documents.</p>
<p>It is our policy to use complete and accurate metadata for all web content.</p>
<h4 id="blogs">Blogs</h4>
<p>Public &amp; Government Affairs will administer a central blog for the county. Other blogs are not permitted unless approved by the Web Governance Committee.</p>
<h4 id="embedding-content">Embedding content</h4>
<p>As a general rule, the county does not permit embedding outside web content on the county website. YouTube and Vimeo are exceptions, as these video services are reliable and facilitate cross-platform and social media integration.</p>
<p>Embedded content—including video—must be approved by the web content editor and the web team at Technology Services.</p>

<h3 id="documents">Documents</h3>
<p>We produce hundreds of documents every week here at Clackamas County, including County Commission meeting packets, agendas, ordinances, permits, applications, bids, RFPs, tables, flyers the list goes on and on.</p>
<p>Because of the importance of documents to our work, we will always need sound document management and support to enhance the public’s ability to locate and interact with the documents they need. To this end, here are some key points to remember about documents on the web:</p>
<h4 id="word-documents">Word documents</h4>
<p>Microsoft Word documents should rarely, if ever, be posted to the website because of compatibility and formatting problems. Additionally, the cost of purchasing Microsoft Word may present a barrier, while PDF document viewers can be obtained for free. Contact Public &amp; Government Affairs or Technology Services if you need assistance converting a Word document to PDF.</p>
<h4 id="scanned-documents">Scanned documents</h4>
<p>Scanned documents are <strong>photographs</strong> of the original document, which means the text is neither selectable nor readable by a search engine or audio screen reader. This means they are extremely difficult or impossible to search for and should rarely if ever be used on the website. Because scanned documents are not accessible to screen readers, they are not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>
<p>In the rare case a scanned document must be used on the website, it should be processed with Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to create selectable text. Also called &quot;text recognition,&quot; The popular PDF application Adobe Acrobat has text recognition capabilities. If you would like assistance in using this feature, contact Public & Government Affairs.
</p>
<h4 id="mobile-devices">Mobile devices</h4>
<p>Documents are difficult to read on a mobile device such as a phone or tablet. Ask yourself if a document format, such as PDF, is the best format for your content on the web. For example, an event flyer may be good for posting in the elevator or coffee shop, but converting the flyer to a web page is more accessible to web visitors and often improves the chances your content will be found by search.</p>
<p>Remember that most PDF documents are meant to be printed or viewed at 8.5”x11”, but people increasingly access web content on their phones, which have much smaller displays than a piece of lettersized paper.</p>
<h4 id="content-maintenance">Content maintenance</h4>
<p>Maintain your documents and webpages! Out-of-date information can be very confusing to the public. Create a schedule for updating content and for removing or replacing documents that are no longer relevant.</p>
<h3 id="url-addresses">URL addresses</h3>
<p>All of the county’s official web communication, information, and resources should originate from <a href="http://www.clackamas.us/">www.clackamas.us</a>.</p>
<p>Occasionally, departments have unique communication needs to support an initiative or project. In rare cases, custom domains can be procured and used to support these unique situations.</p>
<p>Public &amp; Government Affairs and Technology Services approve requests for new domains based on the need for a custom URL and the strategic communications value.</p>
<h4 id="redirect-urls">Redirect URLs</h4>
<p>Redirecting one URL to another can be a handy way to convey visitors to an updated webpage location, however, redirects can create big problems if not used sparingly and wisely. Requests for redirected URLs will only be considered if there is a compelling reason to do so. Requests to redirect one page to another, either from one county page to another or from a county page to an outside page, must be approved by Public &amp; Government Affairs and Technology Services.</p>
<h4 id="referencing-a-url">Referencing a URL</h4>
<p>When writing a URL, use the shortest version possible. For example, instead of <a href="http://www.clackamas.us/pga" class="uri">http://www.clackamas.us/pga</a>, use <a href="http://www.clackamas.us/pga">clackamas.us/pga</a>.</p>
